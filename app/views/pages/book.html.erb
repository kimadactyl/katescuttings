  <h1>Book now available!</h1>

  <p>This is an entertaining read about Kate&#39;s long experience of gardening at &#39;Charnwood&#39;, a Yellow Book Garden in Nottinghamshire she has been developing since 1987. It is full of tips, stories, planting ideas and easy to follow explanations of how to be a successful gardener. It is beautifully illustrated with many colour photos of the garden through the seasons taken by Kevin Pyke, a world renowned plant scientist.</p>

  <p>It is Â£8.50 from Kate in person. If you'd like us to post one to you, contact Kate directly - <%= mail_to "kate@katescuttings.net" %>.</p>
