{"nid":"1","title":"Bulbs for Spring 2012","type":"blog","created":"1314614580","body_value":"Don’t wince, but I’ve actually done my order for spring bulbs next year. I know it sounds ridiculously early to plan for March and April 2012, but because we have an acre of garden, bulk buying well ahead is needed if we are to keep the cost down and get a good choice. I use de Jager (www.dejager.co.uk 01622 840229), a company based in Kent. Their bulbs are good size, they never substitute and they almost always produce good flowers. I’ve ordered 250 Lent Lilies, Pseudonarcissus Lobularis, a small, native daffodil that grows to 15 cm and will look natural and (I hope) gradually increase in our meadow. I’ve picked 2 lily flowering tulips – one called Burgundy and another White Triumphator for pots – they will flower in May if the squirrels don’t find and eat them first. Both grow to around 60cm so they need keeping out of the wind to look their best. Lily flowering tulips are really elegant, and look lovely underplanted with bedding plants such as forget me nots. Tulips like well drained soil, so it’s a good idea to mix a little grit in when you are planting them. I’ve also decided to have another go at lilies in pots – I had to ditch the last lot because the dreaded lily beetle did for them. So I’ve ordered some bulbs of Regale Lily, still my favourite despite endless varieties now on offer. I saw one well known company recently offer dwarf lilies for ground cover – whatever next?!\r\n\r\nAugust and September must be good months for you vegetable gardeners, harvesting all those delicious crops. Even I’ve had some success this year – we’ve got Pink Fir potatoes, sweetcorn, climbing French beans and tomatoes all thriving, despite the dry weather. The asparagus has just about survived: the lack of decent rain early on didn’t do it much good but it is getting going now.\r\n\r\nThe late summer borders have put on a good show this year. One bed has a good, striking colour combination: a large Inula with huge, bright yellow daisies, a tall, intense blue salvia, clear red crocosmia, rudbeckia, golden oregano at the front and a climbing yellow rose at the back. The Romneya, or Californian Tree Poppy has been gorgeous with huge, fragrant white poppy like flowers coming over a long period from July onwards. My favourite salvia, ‘Purple Rain’, with beautiful, grey felty leaves, has been lovely at the front of a sunny border with dahlias behind. The pink buddleia is just coming into its own as I write (mid July) and will soon be covered with bees and butterflies. A group of grasses are at their best now – Molinea in particular has thrown up tall, elegant flower heads that sway beautifully in the breeze. Soon they will start to take on Autumn colours and look even better. I bought a tray of Zinnias from Karen at the Gardening Clubs plant stall at the village event. They are looking fab, beautiful clear, colours in a pot by the front door; they make me smile every time I walk by.\r\n\r\nWe put enough effort into our garden during the year so take some time out to relax and enjoy it!\r\n\r\nHave a good summer!"},
{"nid":"2","title":"Purple rain!","type":"blog","created":"1311795420","body_value":"I’ve been going through a purple phase for quite some time. It was a very trendy colour at Chelsea a few years ago, and it has lingered since as a popular theme. Purple has the advantage of combining with almost every other colour, and looks lovely next to green or grey foliage. Even those gardeners who (unlike me!) prefer gentle, pastel shades usually find deep, rich purple acceptable.\r\n\r\nPurple for Spring: Tulips – my favourites are Van de Neer, which flowers around April and lasts for ages, even in my windy SW facing border, or the gorgeous lily flowered tulip that comes a little later called ‘Burgundy’. Alliums – ‘Purple Sensation’ is very well named; it is a rich, deep purple, elegant bulb flowering usually in May. A. christophii flowers a little later; it is bigger, but has beautiful star shaped looser flowers. It stands around 30 – 40 cm high so, again, doesn’t blow over too easily. Both these bulbs can be left in situ and overplanted by annuals or later flowering perennials and look good threading through flower beds, often seeding around if you give them the sunny, well drained conditions they love.\r\n\r\nPurple for summer: Penstemons, especially ‘Blackbird’, Cleome, sweet peas, zinnias, the list is long. There are lots of purple clematis – I have Perrins Pride growing through a deep red climbing rose (Ena Harkness), Etoille Violette which flowers for ages, and Viticella ‘venosa voilecea’ which also keeps going all summer starting around May. Salvias are great value for money plants, my favourite is ‘Purple Rain’ which has lovely furry grey\/green leaves.\r\n\r\nFor a purple backdrop, Cotinus takes some beating. It is also known as the Smoke Bush as its flowers look like a gentle drift of smoke. It eventually grows into a big shrub, but you can prune it hard. It changes to a fantastic shade of red in the Autumn, another plant that really earns its keep. Hardy geraniums also come in rich shades of purple, ‘Ann Folkard’ and ‘Russell Prichard’ are both great scramblers, although probably they are closer to magenta than purple.\r\n\r\nIn May, Peter and I took up the invitation to visit the Tollerton allotments. It is amazing how much you allotmenteers have achieved in such a short space of time. I bought back some climbing French beans which are just getting going, and some sorrel which tastes unexpectedly of those little fruit salad chewy sweets I used to have when I was but a lass."},
{"nid":"3","title":"Filling the gaps in June","type":"blog","created":"1307968020","body_value":"What a confusing year for plants and gardeners! A horrid, long and cold winter followed by a warm and sunny Spring, lulling plants into thinking summer has come early and then getting nipped by the frost. If you are concerned that, come July, all will be over, I suggest you plant now for some late summer and autumn colour.\r\n\r\nYou may find some bedding plant bargains now, and early June is actually a good time to add tender perennials and annuals to your borders and pots. Call me cynical, but I suspect that garden centres put out those nasty little floppy plugs of bizzie lizzies, fuchsias and geraniums for sale in March in the hope that we put them outside too early, they succumb to frost and we have to go back and buy another lot. It’s like selling winter flowering pansies which, in my view, should more usefully be called ‘winter flowering if you water them, deadhead and feed them and the weather is mild for the time of year’ pansies. But to be fair I suppose that’s a lot to print on a label. And what’s this move to stick perennials in a fancy pink plastic pot, call them ‘garden stars’ or similar and charging seven quid for them? Sorry, I digress.\r\n\r\nThings you can pop into gaps now include dahlias, cannas, cosmos, tobacco plants, verbena, geraniums (pelargoniums), zinnia - the list is long. Later flowering hardy perennials are also available, michaelmas daisies, phlox, salvia (not the dumpy little red bedding ones, there are some gorgeous tall blue perennial salvias, some quite hardy), sedum, and my favourite garden chums, penstemons which flower and flower. You can also plan ahead and sow perennial and biennial seeds to flower next year. Delphiniums and foxgloves are really easy from seed and you will get loads of plants out of a packet."},

Please contact her for more details.She is also an experienced garden writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>Kate<\/h1>\r\nKate has been a mad keen amateur gardener all her life. Both her parents were skilled gardeners, her Mum, Margaret Newton lovingly tended her herbaceous borders until her death in March 2009 just a few weeks short of her 89th birthday.\r\n\r\nInspiration for Kates garden comes from the late Christopher Lloyd, Beth Chatto and more recently Piet Odolf. She is also dreaming of the day Monty Don turns up to visit 'Charnwood' to share their joint passion.\r\n\r\nWhen Kate is not in the garden, she is often reading gardening books. The latest, a Christmas gift from her husband and under-gardener, Peter, is Karel Capeks 'The Gardeners Year'. First published in 1929, it is both clever, funny and surprisingly contemporary: 'Let no-one think that real gardening is a bucolic and meditative occupation. It is an insatiable passion, like everything else to which a man gives his heart'.\r\n\r\n'Charnwood' joined the National Garden Scheme in 2009, it is situated just south of the River Trent in Nottinghamshire. A proportion on the proceeds from the open garden is given each year to Friends of South Wolds School, the local secondary school in Keyworth where Kate has been Chair of Governors since 1996.\r\n\r\nYou can follow Kate on Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/KatesCuttings\">@katescuttings<\/a>"},
{"nid":"6","title":"The Garden","type":"page","created":"1324325575","body_value":"Welcome to our garden. Peter and Kate Foale moved into Charnwood in South Notts with their son, David, in August 1987. As time, money and fitness has been available they have gradually developed the acre of garden and continue to plan new areas. The backdrop of mature trees and countryside makes gardening here a joy.\r\n\r\nThrough the gate the front garden is dominated on the right by a blue cedar, probably at least as old as the house (1950s). The clipped box came from a local nursery, Ivor Thompson and has, unfortunately, been ‘trimmed’ in places by Jamie the dog who sadly passed away in 2009 and was not a great gardener. Walking by the right hand side of the house are 2 weeping pears and opposite a border of ferns (and spring bulbs). At the back of the house on the right we planted a golden weeping birch again from Ivor Thompson.\r\n\r\nThe mainly herbaceous border at the back of the house has penstemons, sedum, hardy geraniums and verberna bonariensis. Next to the patio with the umberella is an acer and hostas leading to a pergola (mind your head, the (David Austin Anniversary) rose is thorny and a little brick courtyard with pots full of plants whihc vary according to the seasons. This takes you through to the more formal garden, most of which was landscaped (Pegasus) and planted (Kate) in Spring 2002. At the end of the path you are taken to a 'secret garden' with bamboo, magnolia, grasses and shrubs. The golden robinia was planted c1990.\r\n\r\nThe yew hedge linking the house to the garage is now 12 years old. If you walk round the right hand side of the garage you will come to the pond, installed in August 2002 by Edd Seeley. Again, we are still experimenting with planting here in the horribly heavy clay with the expert help of our friend and gardeners David Wilson and Matt Pyke. A gunnera, hellebores and woodland planting is now established. The most recent introduction is a swamp cypress which quickly got its feet down into the damp soil.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Kates Mother died, a sad loss as she was a lovely Mum and Grandma and huge inspiration to Kate, especially in the garden. In her memory we asked our architect friend, Simon Wrigley, to draw up plans for a seaside garden, complete with a cobble 'beach', oak railway sleepers to provide some steps and a gravel garden where Kate has planted alpines, grasses, allium  and some choice perennials. It is now complete and should look great in 2012. The garden is open through the NGS 'Yellow Book' on 6 and 7 May 2012. We also open for groups and study days - email kate@katescuttings.net for more information.\r\n\r\nLook out for some interesting and unusual works of art throughout. Our latest acquisition is a four legged friend, Coco the foal. The stumpery at the front is still work in progress - Highgrove need not worry about the competition yet!\r\n\r\nThere are so many people to say thank you to for helping me and Peter make ‘Charnwood’ what it is today.

{"nid":"10","title":"April 2011","type":"blog","created":"1302393600","body_value":"Hurrah! The natural order of The Universe has been restored. Monty Don is back on Gardeners’ World. No more of Toby Buckland’s ’30 minute fixes’, endless clichés and pointless jobs. I know he meant well, and he is actually a well respected and successful garden designer. He just didn’t seem to cut it on the TV, as the huge drop in viewing figures demonstrated.\r\n\r\nWe are full steam ahead getting the garden ready for our NGS opening s on the afternoons of 1 and 2 May. This is when I tend to alternate between feeling happy and content that all will be well, and blind panic that it will be a disaster. It usually tends towards the first state, so I am trying to remain calm. I’ve got lots of good plants to sell; Friends of South Wolds are coming to do home-made teas, and the bulbs and blossom should all look good, so please come, it’s all for charity. Check out the website for pictures and my up to date blog: www.katescuttings.net  We are also happy to open for garden clubs and larger groups.\r\n\r\nOne area we have tackled recently is a sheltered, shady corner in what we pretentiously call our Magnolia Garden. Apart from the magnolia, there are bamboos, hostas, and a variety of shrubs, grasses and perennials; it’s a secret, tranquil area you can feel nicely lost in. The aforementioned shady corner was a bit boring and empty, so we went to Sulney Nursery (in Nether Broughton, also Carrier Landscapes) and as ever got some good advice. So we have planted a lovely, big specimen of Photinus, a large evergreen shrub with red new shoots. It sets off the golden bamboo canes beautifully. We have also planted some pyracantha that will eventually provide a contrasting backdrop and hide the fence.\r\n\r\nI usually get my dahlia tubers going about now. I check them over and cut out any that have shrivelled up or gone mouldy. I split them carefully with a sharp knife and plant them in some compost, keeping  them well watered and in a bit of heat so they are ready to plant out in May when the frosts are over. Getting them started in a pot like this means that they flower earlier and are less susceptible to slug attack, but they still need keeping an eye on. I only have 2 varieties, Bishop of Llandaff – lovely bright red with dark, fern like leaves which set the flowers off beautifully, and David Howard, bright orange with coppery leaves. All being well I will have some of both for sale on 1 and 2 May as well as penstemons, perennials, tomato plants and herbs.\r\n\r\nSince I am a rather half hearted vegetable gardener, I’ve decided to grow more perennial vegetables that should look after themselves  so I ordered some asparagus. They need an open, sunny site and well drained soil with plenty of compost dug in. They were a bit of a pain to plant, you dig a 20cm deep trench, fork in some compost, plant the spidery crowns about 40cm apart, covering them lightly with soil and gradually fill up the trench as they grow. But I’m banking on them being easy once that’s all done, with our own home grown asparagus for years and years to come. I’ll let you know!  This is a lovely time to be in the garden – don’t forget to find some time to sit back every now and again with a cup of tea and enjoy it."},
{"nid":"11","title":"March Prune and Tidy","type":"blog","created":"1300492800","body_value":"March is the month to get the growing season off to a good start. Hardy perennials can be cut back to the ground and the vegetable patch cleared. I also do three pruning jobs this month: I tidy and cut back clematis, prune the shrubby dogwoods and do a serious job on the bamboo before it creeps up in the night and strangles us in our bed.\r\n\r\nClematis are often considered hard to prune, or at least difficult to know how to prune so they can be both kept in check and flower well. A good rule of thumb is to prune the later, usually larger flowering varieties in March back to a bud, about knee height. You will cut loads off and it will take you a while if it is a well established plant, but this will encourage flowers all the way up rather than a few at the top you can’t see properly. Earlier clematis such as Montana or Armandii don’t need pruning unless you need the space. If that is the case, you can prune hard after they have flowered. I have literally cut an Armandii down to the ground and it regrew very well. A spade or two of fresh bonfire ash applied as a mulch now will encourage flower buds to form.\r\n\r\nWe have several of the multi stemmed dogwoods which we grow partly for their brightly coloured bark in winter . To keep the striking red and yellow bark coming, I prune about a third of the oldest, dullest wood out right down to the ground. This means in a three year period you, in effect, get a new plant. Again, give them a feed as it’s pretty hard treatment so they will appreciate a little tlc.\r\n\r\nBamboos are so often left to make boring and congested clumps, so again, we take drastic action at this time of year. We dig up canes that are straying outside their allotted space and thin out all the weaker growing canes. Bamboo grows the same diameter stem throughout its life; if it comes through thin and weakly, it will stay that way. We then stand back and take a look and, if necessary, cut more out, right down to the ground. Then we cut off all the lower growing side shoots so by now you can see through the clump and really appreciate the lovely canes. By the time we have finished the clump is often half the size. And we have a pile of canes to grow sweet peas and beans up. The very low growing varieties I cut down to the ground all over, it soon comes back fresh and green.\r\n\r\nVirburnum beetle is now rated as a significant pest among gardeners. It discolours and munches through the leaves and can completely defoliate a large bush so it’s worth keeping a close eye on and treating at the first sign of trouble. Both organic and non organic treatment is available as a spray, best done mid April. Keep your eye out for those bright red lily beetles as well. I missed a few last year and most of my lilies are now history.\r\n\r\nEnjoy Spring in your garden; I hope the spring bulbs and flowers are helping to raise your spirits during these hard times."},
{"nid":"12","title":"How did your garden fare last winter?","type":"blog","created":"1305244800","body_value":"The current preoccupation with gardeners still seems to be whether or not the winter killed our precious plants. Last month I urged caution – plants may still start to shoot from the base and could do so well into the summer so patience may reward you. Having said that, the 2010\/11 winter was the coldest for 100 years. So with global warming being the hot topic (no pun intended) it’s not surprising if we were lulled into a false sense of security and so planted out that hibiscus, phormium, myrtle or agapanthus last autumn. So what can we do to avoid the same thing happening next winter? You could try:\r\n\r\n•\tLightening the soil with grit or compost. Cold, wet and heavy soils are more likely to kill tender plants than drier, sandier soil;\r\n•\tPlanting tender plants early, as soon as frosts are over if you can. That way they will get their roots deep in the soil and established before the killer cold arrives;\r\n•\tMulch well in autumn – I actually got my Gunneras, Agapanthus and Romneya through last winter with a good, thick cover;\r\n•\tChoosing plants that look tender and exotic but are actually hardy – ferns and hostas for example;\r\n•\tTaking cuttings in summer and keeping them frost free over the winter. Many of us do it with geraniums, but it works with a variety of plants such as penstemons and salvias.\r\n\r\nIf I sound smug, I can reassure you that we have lost hebes, our precious Wollemi pine and at least one acer.\r\n\r\nWith the garden open on the afternoons of 1 and 2 of May, panic has set in and a weeding  operation is in full force.  The difference between last year when we opened late April  2010 and now is huge – the garden looks quite different , I would guess it is about 3 or 4 weeks further forward. This means that some of my carefully chosen bulbs that I planted in Autumn 2009 for a good late spring display may be over, but other treasures such as some early perennials and the wisteria should  be out. So if you came last year, don’t assume it will look the same!  We are offering home-made teas courtesy of friends of South Wolds School this year, and I have a big plant stall. \r\n\r\nTalking of tender perennials, we have just returned from a holiday in Spain. Having seen gorgeous tender choyisias, bourganviliia, plumbago and large flowered jasmine plants thriving in their natural, more or less permanently frost free environments, I do wonder if it may be best to stick to the huge range of plants we can grow successfully in the Midlands of England. But hey, where would be the challenge in that?!\r\n"},
{"nid":"13","title":"Busting garden myths","type":"blog","created":"1296777600","body_value":"What a winter we’ve had, and it’s not over yet! Several plants on the margins of hardiness are looking a bit sad here, but I’m waiting until Spring before I do anything drastic like digging them up as they may yet recover. If it happens to you, try looking on the bright side – if you’ve lost a plant, you now have a brand new opportunity to put something else lovely in its place. Just make sure that, if you chose something a bit borderline hardy, wait a couple of months at least before you plant and cover in fleece if frost is forecast. Keep it well watered as well.\r\n\r\nOne thing I’m glad I did last summer is to take some cuttings. I’ve got several trays of penstemons and salvias in the greenhouse looking fine, so I can fill at least some of the gaps for free. It’s a really good and easy way of ensuring you don’t completely lose something you are fond of, and it takes up little space. Not much use to you now, though if you didn’t do it last year – sorry! I’ll have some for sale on my plant stall when we open the garden again on 1 and 2 May.\r\n\r\nOne of the long standing assumptions of many of us who grow snowdrops is that they are best moved ‘in the green’ or straight after flowering. So I was surprised to read in the latest RHS magazine ‘The Garden’ that this is not longer believed to be the case. Not that the gardening catalogues seem to agree – there are still many adverts to buy them in this state at the moment. The problem with not planting them when they still green is that it’s hard to remember a) where they are if completely dormant and there are no leaves showing and b) where to put them. I tend to end up planting in what appears to be a gap, but turns out to have something underneath the soil. So I plan to carry on lifting and dividing them after flowering on account of the fact I’ve been doing it for years and it works. So there.\r\n\r\nAnother ‘myth’ that has been busted is that it makes no difference to your compost heap if you wee on it. Not that I ever do myself you will be relieved to hear, but as a keen recycler, the idea appeals to me. I have, on occasion, persuaded small boys to do so who think it great fun. It was said to encourage the heap to compost by activating the relevant elements in the heap. Shame if not true.\r\n\r\nIf you were given pots of bulbs such as hyacinths or daffodils over Christmas you can plant them out in the garden to come again next Spring. They will come later, and probably smaller, but they are still pretty and often deliciously fragrant. Deadhead them before you plant . I put a large group of the daintier multi- stemmed white hyacinths all around my shrub roses to give a bit of early interest while the roses do their dead stick impression. I’m looking forward to seeing them in flower, probably and the end of April.\r\n\r\nI’m hoping for a lovely, warm spring when it rains gently and regularly, but after I’m in bed. No horrid winds and early aphid attacks. Lots of thrushes , frogs and toads to eat the slugs and snails. And some lovely days and evenings in the garden with friends and wine. Lovely!"},
{"nid":"14","title":"Roses","type":"blog","created":"1214870400","body_value":"Like many gardeners, we no longer have a bed set aside just for roses. They can look rather boring and ungainly for quite a long time when not in flower, so we have now incorporated them into a mixed border. It's not terribly easy as roses can be a bit unruly, but I try to get round that by planting plants such as foxgloves, euphorbia and penstemons close by.\r\n\r\nOne truly gorgeous rose which flowers late June and into July is Tuscany Superb. It is a deep crimson-purple Gallica rose with golden stamens and a lovely scent. It only flowers once, but it is worth waiting for. I have a deep red Penstemon ' Blackbird' nearby which complements it well. Another rose which has been flowering since the end of May is a climber called 'Laura Ford'. It is a modern rose with small, rich yellow flowers. It doesn't climb too high and so is easy to keep in check. It repeat flowers.\r\n\r\nMme Alfred Carriere is an excellent climber for an exposed wall, it seems to put up with quite exposed as well as shady conditions. It is a Noisette with creamy white flowers. At the front we have planted a screen of natural looking tress and shrubs including the Rugosa roses which have the best scent of all. They are also very robust and thorny, so make excellent burglar deterring hedges.\r\n\r\nClematis make good partners for climbing roses, I have a deep purple one scrambling through the rich red climber Ena Harkness. We also have a small flowered rambler climbing through an old apple tree which no longer fruits reliably and so makes a good host.\r\n\r\nThis is a good month for garden visiting. One we can recommend is 125 Shelford Road in Radcliffe on Trent. We visited last year and it was one of the best local gardens I've seen . There is a bog garden, a jungle style area and even a turf dragon. Overall it's half an acre of really well designed planting and has featured on Gardeners World. Evidently Monty Don liked it, and there is wine, so what more can I say? The garden is open in the evening on 16 July, 6-9pm and again on the afternoon of 14 September.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to keep your containers well fed and watered over the summer. I still think Phostrogen is the best all round liquid feed, I give it to all my plants in and out of doors in pots, usually once a week in the growing season. I am currently having a go at using home made feed made from Comfrey leaves stuffed into water. Smells absolutely disgusting, but the plants seems to like it. I'll keep you posted on the results.\r\n\r\nHappy gardening!"},

Reading through the magazines and books on the subject, here are a few tips I’ve found work well to keep your pots of plants looking good without too much trouble:\r\n\r\nPlant up large rather than small pots, and really water them well. A big pot can take minutes rather than seconds to get wet right down to the roots at the bottom and, if you do the job thoroughly, it doesn’t dry out quickly. Carry on watering until you see insects and water escaping out of the bottom of the pot.\r\nPut pots in groups together rather than singly, again, this will prevent them drying out and save you several trips with a can or hose. I have a group of hostas and busy lizzies in pots in the gentle shade by the front door. There I can keep an eye on them and water them easily and, with the help of a few handfuls of grit on the ground and Vaseline applied round the rims of the pots, I can keep all but the most athletic and hungry of slugs at bay. They look great too.\r\nIf you are planting a shrub or small tree that will be in the pot for years, use a decent compost like John Innes number 3. It has more nutrients to feed the plant for longer and is heavy, preventing the pot from toppling over. We have a wisteria in a large pot which is eventually going to be a standard which we have treated in this way. If you are putting tender plants such as geraniums, agave or other sun lovers, add a handful or two of grit to the compost to improve drainage. Multi purpose composts are often not very free draining which some plants don’t like.\r\nPut the pot in the right position, its no good putting a pot of geraniums in deep shade, or a fern in the sun, they won’t thrive and will look awful.\r\nFeed your plants; they can’t get their roots into really deep soil and so rely on you to give them a decent meal. Most plants including bedding plants and tomatoes seem to like a liquid feed such as phostrogen.\r\nBe bold, a few large pots generously planted look much better than lots of little ones. It’s the bulb season coming up, so now is the time to get big clumps of daffodils in pots.\r\n\r\nIn June we happened to be in Leeds so took the opportunity to visit York Gate Garden. It’s only an acre and is in a suburb north of Leeds called Adel (LS16 8DW). It’s a real gem, set out in the Hidcote style with garden ‘rooms’ of different character. The garden is open April to September on Thursday, Sundays and Bank holiday Mondays in the afternoon, tel 0113 267 8240.\r\n\r\nHappy gardening!"},
{"nid":"16","title":"Creating a meadow","type":"blog","created":"1167523200","body_value":"Being potty about plants, I always have to have a new gardening project on the go. Strongly influenced by our student son who is home for the summer and passionate about ecology, the latest plan is to turn part of the garden into a little wildflower meadow. A trip to the wildflower farm at Langar (www.naturescape.co.uk tel. 01949 860592) early In July was really inspirational. We followed it up with a fair bit of research and garden visits and Project Meadow is well and truly up and running.\r\n\r\nThe site we have picked is in some light woodland under a group of silver birches. Peter stopped mowing the area in May, and self heal, stitchwort, hawkbit, red and white clover, herb robert and birds hop trefoil have all sprung up on their own. A little management is needed even in the wildest meadow, so I’ve regularly pulled up the ‘nasties’ such as ragwort which is poisonous, and thistles which invade horribly if left alone (although I admit I was tempted to leave a few for the goldfinches).\r\n\r\nPlants have been chosen that will enjoy either semi shade or, if planted at the front, sunny conditions. We bought a mixture of little pot grown specimens and seed to see which works best. The plants we simply popped in in little plugs. The seeds will be sown at intervals between now and the spring; we will mow closely selected areas and scarify the soil to break it up a bit. The seed can then be sown and tamp it down well. Some seeds, such a cranesbills, need rubbing with sandpaper to break to seed coat a bit and get them to germinate more easily, a technique called stratification Others are less fussy. We will be exploring more planting opportunities, especially with grasses to create a natural looking meadow which will attract plenty of wildlife.\r\n\r\nSo, next June and July we should have a meadow full of colour. If Project Meadow actually works, as well as the above mentioned plants we will have oxeye daisies, lady’s smock, wood cranesbill, vetch, red campion, and ragged robin. I’m also going to experiment to see if some of the easy plants which seed themselves around in my borders will do well in these conditions, such as the tall white campanula, welsh poppies and hardy geraniums, which would complement their cranesbill cousins.\r\n\r\nI can see myself now next summer, wandering in a floaty frock in the sunshine, through a beautiful meadow. I’ll let you know if it works as well as I imagine it!"},
{"nid":"17","title":"Vivienne Westwood","type":"blog","created":"1283126400","body_value":"After several weeks of dry, hot weather it is raining at last, and doesn’t the garden love it? The fresh, spring look is now gone. We have, for the later summer season, an overgrown, rather blousy, voluptuous look; the garden equivalent of a Vivienne Westwood frock. Out right now in mid July are clematis, tobacco plants, dahlias, blue, red and pink salvia (including a red and white one called ‘hot lips’), helenium, a huge, rangy yellow inula that must stand over 5 feet tall, tall and short phlox, sweet peas (annual and perennial) roses, penstemons, macleaya (see picture) , day lilies, the huge golden oat (Stipa) and last, but not least, the huge tissue paper-like white flowers of the Californian Tree Poppy (Romneyi).\r\n\r\nSo it’s a good time to sit back and enjoy. If you are in need of some summer jobs, however, I’ve managed to find a few to keep you out of mischief over the summer months:\r\n\r\nCollect annual seeds, dry them out and keep them in a cool dry place until you are ready to sow them next spring\r\nKeep container grown plants fed and watered, even if it rains, raindrops can bounce off full pots, not reaching the soil\r\nSummer prune apple and pear espaliers and cordons\r\nTake cuttings – penstemons, rosemary, pelagoniums and lavender will all root readily now giving you plants next year for free\r\nKeep deadheading flowers to keep the show going\r\nRemove whippy shoots from your wisteria\r\nThin and shorten shoots of rambling roses\r\nPrune late summer flowering shrubs after flowering\r\nGive meadows a cut when seed has set and remove the clippings\r\nGet your compost bins set up and in use.\r\n\r\nAnd another thank you to all of you who visited our garden this year. We had 410 visitors in total and raised £1519 for charity. Thanks especially to the Tollerton Gardening Club who were a joy to have here (not least because of the vast quantity of wine we got through!) but also because of their good humour and appreciation of the garden. You are welcome any time!\r\n\r\nHave a good summer."},
{"nid":"18","title":"April Armandii","type":"blog","created":"1207094400","body_value":"April is the month our Armandii clematis flowers, and it's a wonderful sight. I'm told it gets its name because it has an almond fragrance, but the smell reminds me more of nutmeg. Whatever, it's a good smell and its pale pink (it also comes in white) flowers cover the plant which reaches almost the top of our house. What is great about this early flowering variety is that if it gets too big, you can cut it back a little or a lot after flowering, but its not necessary otherwise. Many folk worry about pruning clematis, but you can't go far wrong if you cut back the later flowering varieties to a fat bud about now and give them a good feed, mulch (incorporating a handful of wood ash) and water. That way you won't get all the flowers at the top where you can't see them, leaving you looking at a bunch of brown stems. If its a viticella, the smaller flowered sort that look good clambering through shrubs, you can cut all growth back now to about 30 cm. Clematis like a cool, damp root run and decent soil for best results.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I can't always remember exactly what I planted where (I had 15 at the last count), so I usually cut the late spring and summer clematis back to a bud about knee height and hope for the best; I don't often get failures. The worst than can happen is you lose flowers for a year. One that this works well for is 'Marie Boisselet' which has a large, white flowers and scrambles over a pyracantha. It flowers for ages in summer and really brightens up a rather dull shrub.\r\n\r\nApril is also snakes head fritillery month in our garden. We have small but growing group of them planted in grass in a damp patch next to the pond. They gradually increase each year by self seeding and are beautiful in a subtle sort of way. You have to get down on your knees to their level to appreciate them properly, but it's worth it. They belong to the lily family and have little bell shaped, nodding heads of purple and white. They are susceptible to the red lily beetle, so keep your eye out from now onwards for these on your lilies, Solomon's' seal as well as fritilleries. The little devils can do no end of damage – you can't miss them they are really bright scarlet. I'm normally a peace loving vegetarian, but I have no compunction to squashing them with my boot.\r\n\r\nNow is the time to deadhead your daffodils and give them a feed. They will take back the food into their bulbs and give you another great show next year. Don't be tempted to tidy them up by tying them into bundles or, worse still, cutting their leaves off. It's equivalent to starving a living thing, so take pity on them and think of the flowers next year.\r\n\r\nIf you missed last month's Shires Plant Fair in the Central Avenue West Bridgford, the next is on 3 May. Its a good one, with specialist nursery women and men selling plants they have grown themselves. This means you get some interesting and unusual plants for sale and good advice on how to grow them well. Our gardens are often so pretty in April, so let's all make sure we take time out to appreciate them. If you visit a garden and have enjoyed it, please let me know so I can pass it on to the good folk of Tollerton.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, happy gardening and watch out for those beetles!"},

Either way they can add a bold splash of colour to the garden.\r\n\r\nI have a border which looks good in the Spring which is planted under an espalier pear. It has a lily flowered variety of tulip called Ballerina underplanted with deep blue forget me nots. The combination of white blossom on the pear, orange tulips and blue forget me nots is lovely as long as the forget me nots don't succumb to mildew.\r\n\r\nI love the lily flowered tulips, they are so elegant. Last year I bought a variety called 'Burgundy'. Aptly named, it has gorgeous purple\/red flowers on long stems. This year I'm planning a new alpine garden, so I've ordered some of the smaller tulips, a variety called 'Little Beauty' which grows to only 10 cm to add some instant colour. The catalogue describes them as 'vivid rosy purple with striking deep blue centre edged white'; they will enjoy the well drained, open aspect I've got planned for them. If you like something a bit less garish, there are some pretty white tulips, the best in my view being 'White Triumphator which is widely available in garden centres. They have long stems, so don't plant them somewhere too exposed.\r\n\r\nThe alpine garden has been long in the planning and I've had lots of fun thinking about it and, of course, begging and buying plants. I've got pinks, the smaller, mat growing ones such as our native cheddar pink which is so easy to grow from cuttings or 'pipings' to give them their correct name.and Dianthus 'Mystic Star' is another pink which smells of chocolate. Creeping thymes and low growing Sedums will make little carpets of colour. A plant new to me is Erodium guttatum which has pretty, feathery leaves and red and white flowers from May to August. For a little height I've found a dwarf grass, Miscanthus sinensis 'Silver Stripe' which should reach around 50cm. The smaller, neater hardy geraniums will be moved from elsewhere in the garden where they are getting swamped by bigger plants and my Auriculas which currently get neglected in pots will have new homes where they can get their roots well down into the soil.\r\n\r\nLooking out of the window as I write in mid September I am enjoying a lovely combination of planting which actually worked how I intended for a change. It is the Dahlia 'David Howard', orange flowers and bronze leaves; white Cosmos I grew from seed called 'Purity' and purple Verbena Bonariensis. It has looked good now since late July and will continue until the frosts see it off.\r\n\r\nHere's hoping for a sunny, colourful Autumn!"},
{"nid":"20","title":"Perennial vegetables","type":"blog","created":"1270072800","body_value":"You don’t need me to tell you that growing your own vegetables is very trendy at the moment as well as a good idea. My son had a balcony in his small flat groaning under the weight of potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, herbs and strawberries last year. I have to admit, he put me to shame as growing things to eat is not really my passion, unless it’s in the form of a lovely old fruit tree I can grow a rose or clematis up. It seems a lot of hard work and, unlike perennials, bulbs, shrubs and trees, at the end of the growing season, you have to start all over again. You also have to try and remember your crop rotation, when to sow the seeds and plant them out and which particular nasty insect or animal to guard against. (I know I will get taken to task now by you keen allotment holders!).\r\n\r\nSo I’ve found a solution- grow perennial crops, hooray! I have already got a Globe Artichoke which looks lovely as well as tasting good. Rhubarb, redcurrants, alpine strawberries and raspberries are already in place. So what else? Asparagus may be worth a go, if I can get time and energy to prepare a weed free bed for them. Now is a good time, but they will want a raised bed on our heavy clay as they like good drainage. You can by year old roots or crown now and plant about 60 cm apart, remember to give them an annual mulch. A well looked after asparagus bed will keep going for years and years. My rhubarb is looking very sad, I had better give that a good mulch as well. Other perennial crops are seakale, Jerusalem artichokes, sea beet or perpetual spinach and even wild rocket can be established as a perennial. Bear in mind that ‘perennial’ does not mean immortal – you will need to feed and replant from time to time to keep your plants cropping well and they will still need weeding.\r\n"},
{"nid":"21","title":"AGM plants","type":"blog","created":"1288121100","body_value":"A mild spell in Autumn is a good time for planting many things. If you are struggling to choose which variety of plant, tree, shrub or even vegetable to go for, one way of dividing the good from the indifferent is to pick a variety that has earned the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit. To (roughly) quote the RHS website at http:\/\/www.rhs.org.uk\/Plants\/Plant-trials-and-awards\/Plant-awards\/Award-of-Garden-Merit-(AGM):\r\nThe AGM is intended to be of practical value to the home gardener. It is awarded therefore only to a plant that meets the following criteria:\r\n\r\nIt must be of outstanding excellence for ordinary garden decoration or use\r\nIt must be available and of good constitution\r\nit must not require highly specialist growing conditions or care or be particularly susceptible to any pest or disease\r\nIt must not be subject to an unreasonable degree of reversion in its vegetative or floral characteristics.\r\nThough growing conditions and plant types may vary, the purpose of the award is always the same: to highlight the best plants available. The AGM is only awarded after a period of assessment, drawing upon the knowledge and experience of a wide range of members, including specialist growers and well-known horticulturists. Assessment for AGM takes place often by running trials at one of the Society's gardens or at some other venue. If you have visited one the RHS gardens you may have see a trial in progress.\r\n\r\nSome of my favourite plants that have the AGM include:\r\nAnenome blanda ‘White Splendour’. This is best planted after giving the little tubers a good soak in Autumn. It looks lovely in a woodland setting and will stand some shade, growing to 6” high, with delicate, almost ferny leaves . Several of my favourites Narcissus have the awards – February Gold, Jenny and Tete a Tete. All good ‘doers’ which flower year after year without a lot of tlc. Many ferns are listed. One of the easiest, even thriving in dry shade, is Dryopteris felix-mas. I have a little group by a seat under a tree and it really does look good for 10 months of the year. An unfussy shrub is Buddleia ‘Pink Delight, a great plant for butterflies. Even the humble foxglove has won the award, albeit its more cultivated cousin Digitalis ‘Excelsior’. This is a rewarding plant, easy to grow and gives height and structure to the early summer garden. Gardeners Delight and Sungold tomatoes are some of the many vegetables with the AGM. The entire list is available on the RHS website. Happy planting!"},

They can be both friend and foe in the garden, I know, but they are lovely and they remind you that there is still life out there. Vary their food for a wider variety of birds and clean out nesting boxes now as they will soon start eyeing up possible new homes to bring up their new families in the Spring.\r\nLook through the seed catalogues; they will remind you that the growing season will soon be here.\r\nMake a plan for a new vegetable or flower bed – even if you don’t end up doing it, the thought will cheer you up.\r\nPlant a winter pot with spring bulbs and bedding plants and put it right by the front door so you see it several times a day. Some tulips and daffodils are scented so look out for those.\r\nBest wishes for Christmas and the New Year; I will be here again next February when the snowdrops, aconites and early daffodils will be out. So keep well and happy until then."},
{"nid":"23","title":"Wollemi Pine","type":"blog","created":"1201888140","body_value":"There has been much excitement at the Foale household as we are now proud owners of a Wollemi Pine. Peter bought me a lovely little specimen for Christmas, with bright green fern type leaves larger and flatter than a yew. If you don't know the story of this remarkable tree, it was around up to 200 million years ago and was thought extinct. Then, in 1994, a park ranger called David Noble was exploring the Wollemi National Park in Australia and stumbled across a small grove of them growing in a remote canyon. What struck him particularly was the trees bark, which looks like bubbling chocolate.\r\n\r\nTo cut a long story short, it was eventually identified and is now being produced in large numbers as an insurance policy against any disaster. They are expensive to buy, but everyone who has one can take part in a conservation effort; each Wollemi Pine sold returns a royalty to conserve the pine and other threatened species. And don't go looking for it if you visit Australia, the location of the trees are a closely guarded secret to protect them from collectors, vandals and diseases. Fewer than 100 trees have been found in the wild. You can, however, see more mature specimens now in many botanical gardens in this country and abroad. The blurb that comes with our tree claims that it is easy to grow and not fussy about where it is planted. It can be grown in a pot in its early years, and even coppiced to make a multi stemmed tree, but I'm not sure I've got the nerve to slice the trunk off! It has lots of unusual features, for example during the colder months the Wollemi Pine becomes dormant and its growing buds develop a pink and white waxy coating. I think Wolly the Wollemi is going to give us endless years of fascination into our old age. If you want to know more there is a website: www.wollemipine.co.uk and a book: The Wollemi Pine by James Woodford.\r\n\r\nIf the damp and grey weather is getting you down, why not have a mooch round the seeds in the garden centre? Many can be sown directly into the ground from next month. Annuals such as poppies, Calendula (pot marigold) and Nigella (love in a mist) are lovely and really easy. Just sprinkle them on to some decent, raked soil, cover them lightly and water well. Keep them watered while they are small and thin them when they get going. Be ruthless, they like space to develop into healthy plants. Once you have them, they will probably seed themselves around each year. They may also cover up the leaves of spring bulbs that look messy as they are dying off. You can also sow some vegetable seeds now, I'll try and get my tomato seeds going on the windowsill early next month.\r\n\r\nIf you have had any little pots of hyacinths or daffodils to brighten up the house, you can plant them outside when they have finished flowering. Deadhead them and plant each bulb at least twice its own depth, don't remove the leaves as these will provide food as they are dying down for next years flower. If you pop them round perennials, they provide a bit of interest early in the year, then disappear obligingly when the perennials come into their own.\r\n\r\nLet's hope 2008 is a good gardening year for us, warm sunny days, gentle rain at night and a huge invasion of ladybirds and frogs to keep the nasties at bay. We can dream!"},
{"nid":"24","title":"October 2008","type":"blog","created":"1222898400","body_value":"If I only had one space in the garden for a fruit tree, it would be a greengage. We have a rather elderly specimen here that crops sparsely at the best of times, but the fruit is absolutely delicious. A couple of years ago we got a relatively heavy harvest. For an easy pudding I halved and stoned the gages and put them in a buttered baking dish. Sprinkled with brown sugar, baked for about half an hour and served with vanilla ice cream - they didn't last long!\r\n\r\nSecond choice would be a plum. I tried to find out what the difference is between a plum and a 'gage'. If you will excuse the pun, it wasn't a very fruitful search. All I can pass on to you is that the first gages in this country were imported from France in 1725 by Sir William Gage. As a result he gave his name to sweet yellow plums that became a Victorian delicacy.\r\n\r\nWe do have a Marjories Seedling tree which has large, purple and juicy plums; at their best about now. This variety is especially good as it is both self fertile and late flowering, avoiding frost damage to the flowers early in the season. Plums and 'gages like an open, sunny spot and little or no pruning. If you do need to prune, set to in Spring or Summer when the sap is rising. When choosing a plum tree, check to see if it needs a pollinator nearby and what rootstock it is grafted on to. A dwarfing rootstock is obviously best for a small garden.\r\n\r\nYou don't need me to tell you what another rubbish summer we have had. To keep my spirits up and look ahead to what must be better weather for gardeners next year, I'm going to sow some sweet peas now. The last time I tried an Autumn sowing, our resident greenhouse mice ate the tasty new shoots, so I have some wire ready to protect them. The Grandiflora varieties have the best scent, which I love, so I will sow them soon in our cold greenhouse; a few seeds in a tall pot to give them a good root run. They shouldn't want any heat unless it gets down to Arctic temperatures and, after being well watered at the start, they will only need a little. In the spring I will harden them off outside, pinching out the tips when they reach about 10 cm. Eventually they will be planted out in a well manured and sunny spot, to grow up some netting. If you prefer larger flowers rather than strong perfume, the Spencer varieties are best.\r\n\r\nI usually plant sweet peas in the vegetable patch to brighten it up a bit and to encourage beneficial insects, but I have seen them growing up fancy wigwams in quite posh gardens. It's a quick way of getting a bit of height into a border, it can also work well with perennial climbers such as clematis.\r\n\r\nNow Autumn is upon us and the leaves are starting to fall, it's time to plan for the future and start off some leaf mould. All you need to do is fill some black plastic bags full of damp leaves, tie the top and make a few holes in the bag. Stick them behind the shed where they won't annoy you and leave them for at least a year, preferably two. The leaves will turn into beautiful dark, crumbly compost and it's one of the best soil conditioners around.\r\n\r\nMy next project for a dark area of the garden is a stumpery – I'll let you know if it works!"},
{"nid":"25","title":"Garden Design","type":"blog","created":"1265038680","body_value":"It has been written that you can spot a well designed garden even in the depths of winter. This assertion is usually made in a posh garden design book and accompanied by smart pictures of strategically placed and immaculately clipped box, or an expensive looking piece of sculpture at the end of a classically laid York stone path.\r\n\r\nThere is much debate about the principles which guide garden design. For example there are those who prefer ‘garden rooms’ where each smaller garden has a particular theme or planting style. I have seen this done even in quite small outside spaces, where a secluded rose or herb garden is tucked away in a peaceful and sunny spot, or a gravelled area gives the owner the opportunity for some trendy minimalist planting perhaps with some Yuccas or Euphorbias. Two of the great gardens which use this style beautifully are Hidcote and Sissinghurst. There have, however, been some new development in keeping with concerns for our planet. To quote John Brookes, an acknowledged expert on the subject:\r\n\r\n‘There is now, without doubt, a concern for a reappraisal of the principles of making a garden merge into its setting, and this is today linked with an ecological awareness. The wildflower garden in Great Britain and the Prairie garden look of the United States are good examples’.\r\n\r\nUsing the landscape surrounding your plot can be a really good way of making your garden look more spacious and more natural. We have a field running along the back of our garden which we can see some lovely trees well into the distance. So we have deliberately not obscured the view too much, and kept to native plants on the boundary such as fruit trees and hollies to blur the transition a little. If you have an ugly hedge or building close by, that’s another matter. Even then there are several things you can do to brighten up that kind of aspect, perhaps with climbers, or a strategically placed tree or shrub to take you eye away from the offending view.\r\n\r\nWhile it can be hard to find the time and money to create a beautifully designed garden set beautifully in its surroundings, there are some simple things you can do to improve the look of your outside space:\r\n\r\n• Think about what you want from your garden. Don’t plant expensive and precious plants where the children and going to play football or the dog is going to wee. It may sound obvious, but some thought before you start is almost never a waste of time.\r\n• Get to know your garden properly – where is it sunny for most of the day and so good for a seat, where is it damp, what direction does the prevailing wind come from? This will help you to make wiser and more successful planting choices.\r\n• Use repetition. I bought some cheap Cordylines from Moores nursery – their spiky leaves planted at intervals now weave through the border, breaking up the monotony of the rather flat surrounding planting .\r\n\r\nAnd remember, blow convention or fashion, it’s your garden, so if you are happy with it, that’s all that matters."},
{"nid":"27","title":"Open Garden - April 2010","type":"blog","created":"1275399360","body_value":"Last week a kind friend gave me some cutting of some Mrs Simpkins, a lovely, fragrant member of the Dianthus family usually referred to as ‘Pinks’. Mrs S is a white pink – confusing, I know. I did read somewhere that the common name ‘pink’ refers to the shaggy edges to the flowers – they look as if they have been cut with a pair of pinking shears – rather than their colour. True or not, they are lovely, fragrant flowers. Whenever I smell their scent, it takes me back to my childhood where our next door neighbour had pinks edging her paths. Their perfume was just gorgeous.\r\n\r\nMy favourite Dianthus is the native Cheddar Pink. It stays quite neat, is low growing and has little, bright pink single flowers on and off throughout the summer and into autumn. They come true from seed, unlike the bigger and posher hybrids. Propagating pinks is easy and now is a good time. Chose healthy shoots with 4 or 5 pairs of leaves and cut cleanly below a joint. Cut off the bottom 2 or 3 pairs of leaves and insert the cuttings (sometimes called pipings) into gritty compost and keep damp. They will root within a few weeks.\r\n\r\nJune is also foxglove month. Their tall spires are lovely in almost any situation, in sun or part shade. They are usually biannual, germinating and growing a strong rosette of leaves in their first year, and flowering the next. They often run out of steam then and are best pulled out unless you want them to seed themselves about. The best variety I have found so far is ‘Excelsior’. They are a bigger, more varied version of the native foxglove and very easy to grow from seed. Sow them anytime now, get some soil to a fine tilth and sow them direct into the garden. Keep them watered and thin them out when they start to make decent little plants. If necessary move them where you want them at the beginning of Autumn to give them time to establish and you will have a fabulous show next summer.\r\n\r\nThe dust has settled and we are now recovered from the garden opening in April. Thank you if you supported us, we had 250 visitors and raised £940 for charity including plant sales. Apart from the seaside garden complete with a pebble estuary and deckchairs, the most admired plants in the garden were the pair of weeping pears at the side of the house. Their grown up name is Pyrus salicifolia Pendula, a really elegant tree with weeping branches clothed with downy, willow-like leaves. When we opened at the end of April they looked at their very best, with their delicate white flowers combining beautifully with the silvery green leaves. Underplanted with bluebells, wood anemones and white daffodils (Thalia) it was one area of the garden that was really appreciated by you garden lovers.\r\n\r\nThe work has started for the next opening, so please come and visit us. This time we are opening in the evening and will be offering a free glass of wine or juice to add to the experience! If you visited us in April the garden will look quite different; roses, clematis, foxgloves and the earlier perennials should be out and the garden will be much more lush. There are pictures of the garden in April now on our website: www.katescuttings.net\r\n\r\nWe are open on Wednesday 23 June 5 to 8.30. We hope to see you then."},
{"nid":"28","title":"Magnolias and Wisterias","type":"blog","created":"1209664020","body_value":"May is Magnolia and Wisteria month in our garden. We love Wisteria and have four plants altogether. The oldest and best covers the back of the house, facing roughly south west. Its grown up name is W. Macrobotrys and its large, blue flowers on long, loose racemes give a lovely, almost filigree effect. Two more are Chinese wisterias trained over a pergola. One has white, gloriously fragrant flowers and the other blue. The fourth is a newer acquisition and is in a very large pot which we are attempting to train as a standard.\r\n\r\nTo get the best out of your wisterias, you need to prune them hard early in the year around February. Once you have the basic framework established which will probably take around three years depending in the area you want it to cover, you need to prune the side shoots down really hard, to 2 or 3 buds. Be bold - you will end up with a big pile of prunings and a fairly sparse plant if you do it properly. Tie the main branches in to strong supports; it's a rampant heavy plant and can topple a tree or bend your guttering once it gets going. It needs a feed after pruning and again later in the summer. After flowering around July (it's not critical), you can prune it back again, but more gently. If you are buying one now, pay a fair bit for a good, grafted plant. Some are not grafted and take literally decades to flower properly.\r\n\r\nMagnolias don't need or appreciate pruning. They prefer a sheltered site and soil that is fairly neutral or acid and not too dry. I give ours a watering can full of sequestrated iron when I remember in the growing season: camellias and rhododendrons like that treatment too. One of my favourite magnolias which I have yet to plant here is M. x loebneri ' leonard messel'. It is a fairly upright shrub that can eventually reach 10m tall so you need space for it, but it has dainty, pinky lilac flowers like a bird's tail. It's a bit more subtle and pretty than the more common M. x soulangeana which is a bit of a mucky pink and now past its best. You often see it planted next to lurid yellow forsythia and it clashes horribly (you may disagree, let me know....)\r\n\r\nI know I keep going on about it, but have you got your compost bins ready? It's just such a satisfying gardening task to throw all your garden and uncooked kitchen vegetable waste into a big heap and get lovely, crumbly stuff out of it a few months later. When I say ALL your gardening waste, don't put in perennial weeds or they will end up spread round your whole garden. Think of it like a cake or a good curry, not too wet, not too dry and with a good mixture of elements including grass clippings, shredded prunings and card or paper, vegetable peelings, and various materials from your borders such as spent bedding plants. A ratio of two parts green stuff to one part paper or woody material is about right, but don't worry too much, its not an exact science. Every now and again turn the whole lot out, give it a stir and put it back to incorporate some air. If it's dry, give it water or some fresh grass clippings. If it's a bit soggy and smelly throw in some shredded paper. It's so much more productive and cheaper than going to the gym. This time of year grass clippings will make the compost really hot and steamy, kill off all the weed seeds and get it off to a good start. For good bins, the wiggly wigglers website is a good source: www.wigglywigglers.co.uk or 'phone 01981 500391. They do a range of useful kit for gardeners as well as worms for your compost heap, wild flowers and bird food.\r\n\r\nGet out there, you know you want to really!"},
{"nid":"29","title":"March jobs in the garden","type":"blog","created":"1204329600","body_value":"This is the time of year to roll your sleeves up, put on your boots and old clothes and get out there. A few hours gardening now will save you lots of effort later, and you will get better results.\r\n\r\nJobs you can be doing include:\r\n\r\n<strong>Prune and mulch:<\/strong> Buddleias, roses and most clematis to name a few. Prune back to a bud to prevent dieback then give them a good feed and mulch. Coloured stemmed dogwoods can be cut back almost to ground level if you want to encourage the bright stems again for next year. If that seems a bit drastic, cut a third back each year. The RHS website has a good guide on to how to prune a variety of plants, but be brave, don't just trim the tops off unless you like a garden full of lollipops. Mulching your borders will keep the moisture in and the weeds down, and looks good.\r\n\r\n<strong>Seed sowing:<\/strong>  vegetables including tomatoes and peppers as well as many perennials, herbs, grasses and annuals can be sown in March and April and it's much cheaper and more satisfying than buying plants.\r\n\r\n<strong>Take delphinium cuttings:<\/strong>  Do this now before they get too big. Take firm shoots of about 10 cm long and cut from as low down the emerging plant as possible. It may feel a bit wrong as they are rather fragile looking, but if your plants are a decent size, they won't miss a few stems. Put them in a pot of gritty compost, keep well watered, cool and frost free and they will root fairly quickly, especially if you use hormone rooting powder. Pot them on and plant them out when they are well established.\r\n\r\n<strong>Take the shears to overgrown ivy:<\/strong>  We have been waging war on knee deep ivy which was planted many years ago at the front as ground cover. It's done a great job, but is now throttling the trees and shrubs. So, with Matt's help, we have removed barrow loads of it in the full knowledge that it will grow back eventually.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lift and divide your snowdrops:<\/strong>  When they have finished flowering but still 'in the green', you can dig clumps up, split them into smaller ones and spread them around.\r\n\r\n<strong>Start an asparagus bed:<\/strong>  Prepare the ground really well as the plants will be in situ for years and years. It's a crop that demands patience and a fair bit of work, but worth it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Get more compost bins:<\/strong>  ready for when you start mowing the lawn. Mix in vegetable peelings, shredded paper or prunings and the contents of your rabbit's cage to give it a good chance of rotting down into a wonderful, dark, crumbly soil conditioner.\r\nPrepare the site for a new lawn: As with asparagus, time spent in preparation getting the soil right is rarely wasted.\r\n\r\nBut be careful. If you haven't done much gardening for a while, take regular breaks and keep stretching your back out. I tend to mix jobs, a lighter job with a heavier task and keep switching between. I don't want the blame if you end up hobbling in to your GP's surgery next week!"},
{"nid":"30","title":"Right Plant Right Place","type":"blog","created":"1212342360","body_value":"When choosing plant for your garden, what is it that helps you to decide? Do you, like me, have an anxiety attack if there is a gap in your border? Perhaps you buy on impulse because the flowers are pretty, or the right colour, or flower at the right time? Or do you chose for structure or size? How many times have you bought a plant that claims to be compact and ends up a few years later as a giant shrub? And do you consider the conditions you are planting into before you buy?\r\n\r\nI have several mature plants of galtonia which I had grown from seed some years ago that had outgrown their pots. So I decided to consult my garden dictionary to find the best spot for these now large bulbs in the garden. The description went as follows:\r\n\r\nGaltonia: Genus of summer flowering bulbs grown for their elegant spikes of funnel shaped flowers. Needs a sheltered, sunny site and fertile, well drained soil that does not dry out in summer.\r\n\r\nRight, so it needs shelter, sun and soil that is not dry but is well drained. How on earth do I replicate that? At a recent plant sale, I asked a specialist iris grower what conditions her bulbous iris preferred. She said they liked well drained clay soil. Have you ever come across such a thing? Not without tons of compost to break it up and endless digging I hear you say, and could you call it clay soil then?\r\n\r\nThe conclusion I've come to is not to worry too much about such things. Its obviously no good planting a herb that originated on a sun baked Mediterranean hillside in a shady bog garden, or an acer in a site exposed to a constant gale, but as long as you are reasonably sensible and are prepared to water in your new plants well in their first year, most plants will do their best to survive. If you get it wrong the first time, you can usually move it and try again.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in finding out more about what to plant where, Beth Chatto is the expert and has written books about her experience of planting in both dry and wet sites. In her garden near Colchester in Essex she planted up a dry garden on the site of an old car park which has thrived magnificently throughout many hot and some not so hot summers. It's well worth a visit if you are ever in the area, there is a gorgeous woodland garden and a plant nursery as well. The website with an on-line catalogue is www.bethchatto.co.uk telephone 01206 822007.\r\n\r\nNow is a great time to go visiting gardens. If you pick up a National Gardens Scheme yellow book, you will find dozens of lovely private gardens to roam around for about £2.50 a time, many of them local. New NGS gardens this year open this year and close to Tollerton include 17 Main Street Keyworth (June 1), and Elms Farm in Bassingfield (10 August), both in the afternoon. If you visit a garden and enjoy it, please let me know and I'll include your recommendation on this page.\r\n\r\nHappy gardening!"},
{"nid":"31","title":"Weeds and Perspective","type":"blog","created":"1217628000","body_value":"Are you sick of weeding? How is it that weeds seem to grow as soon as your back is turned when your carefully tended plants often don't? You may have heard it said that a weed is a plant in the wrong place. I'm not sure when a dandelion is ever in the right place in the garden, but I suppose if you were a rabbit you may disagree. As with many things in life, its all a matter of perspective.\r\n\r\nSo, when I read in our paper last month of the huge benefit some 'weeds' can bring to the garden, I decided to read on. Take nettles. Horrid, pernicious stingy things I hear you cry. But no, they are an excellent addition to the compost heap (without roots). And you can make a liquid feed out of them by adding a few leaves to water and leaving them to steep for a couple of weeks. They also provide a home to over 40 insects as well as seeds for birds to eat. You can make herb tea and nettle beer out of them. Our slightly off the wall hippy son reckons you can gently steam the young tips of nettles and they taste good as a vegetable, but I admit we haven't been tempted to try that particular recipe. If you do, please let me know how you get on and remember to wear stout gloves when you pick nettles, I don't want the blame for your sore hands!\r\n\r\nEven the humble chickweed can be seen in a good light, attracting beneficial insects and with edible tender leaves. You can feed it to your chickens , it is full of vitamins. To get rid of it from your borders tackle it before it flowers by hoeing on a hot day. It's an annual and shallow rooted so it will shrivel and not reappear (at least that plant won't!).\r\n\r\nDandelions, if cut when young, can be tasty when a few are mixed with other leaves in a salad. They produce a gas which can be used to ripen fruit, so if you have green tomatoes at the end of the season, try putting them in a container with a few dandelions and see if they ripen more quickly. Weeding dandelions is tricky; they have a long tap root which needs digging out in its entirety or it will regrow even from a tiny piece of root left in the soil.\r\n\r\nOther things can be good to eat and look pretty in salads. Day lily flowers are crunchy and tasty when young and can be gently fried in light batter. Calendulas and nasturtium flowers are good in salads. Bright blue, star-like Borage flowers can be frozen into ice cubes and added to Pimms, they look lovely too.\r\n\r\nAugust is a good time to have a bit of a tidy in the garden. Keep dead heading roses, dahlias and other perennials as well as annuals to keep them flowering and give them a feed. Cut back hard violas, alchemilla mollis and hardy geraniums and in 3 or 4 weeks they will bounce back, possibly even flowering again in the Autumn.\r\n\r\nWandering around the garden to check out the fruit trees in mid July I noticed that all the plums were at the top of the tree, nothing at all within my reach. The squirrels will enjoy them no doubt. After all, plums in easy picking distance depends where you are standing, its all a matter of perspective!\r\n\r\nEnjoy the rest of the summer in your garden."},
{"nid":"32","title":"Growing your own veg","type":"blog","created":"1271603545","body_value":"Kates cuttings\r\nYou don’t need me to tell you that growing your own vegetables is very trendy at the moment as well as a good idea. My son had a balcony in his small flat groaning under the weight of potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, herbs and strawberries last year. I have to admit, he put me to shame as growing things to eat is  not really my passion, unless it’s in the form of a lovely old fruit tree I can grow a rose or clematis up.  It seems a lot of hard work and, unlike perennials, bulbs, shrubs and trees, at the end of the growing season, you have to start all over again. You also have to try and remember your crop rotation, when to sow the seeds and plant them out and which particular nasty insect or animal to guard against. (I know I will get taken to task now by you keen allotment holders!).\r\n\r\nSo I’ve found a solution- grow perennial crops, hooray! I have already got a Globe Artichoke which looks lovely as well as tasting good. Rhubarb, redcurrants, alpine strawberries  and raspberries are already in place. So what else? Asparagus may be worth a go, if I can get time and energy to prepare a weed free bed for them. Now is a good time, but they will want a raised bed on our heavy clay as they like good drainage. You can by year old roots or crown now and plant about 60 cm apart, remember to give them an annual mulch. A well looked after asparagus bed will keep going for years and years. My rhubarb is looking very sad, I had better give that a good mulch as well. Other perennial crops are seakale, Jerusalem artichokes, sea beet or perpetual spinach and even wild rocket can be established as a perennial. Bear in mind that ‘perennial’ does not mean immortal – you will need to feed and replant from time to time to keep your plants cropping well and they will still need weeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlans are going reasonably well for our garden opening this month. I admit to some panic in March when nothing seemed to be moving at all, but, with luck, both early and late bulbs should be out, putting on a decent show. Opening times again in case you missed them last month:\r\n\r\nSunday April 25 and Wednesday April 28 from 2 to 5pm.\r\n\r\nI’ve been planting all autumn and winter for a white and green colour scheme, with white tulips, anenomes and daffodils under white blossom and lovely acid green leaves on the trees and David and Matt have been pruning and tidying like mad.  Whether our hard work has paid off or not you will have to come and judge for yourselves!  There are quite a few gardens open in April in the Yellow Book including  Ashdene in Halam and 1 Lyncombe Gardens in Keyworth,  both open  on 18th of this month. \r\n\r\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Charnwood later this month.\r\n"},
{"nid":"33","title":"Keeping the colour going, planning for succession","type":"blog","created":"1274196022","body_value":"Keeping the garden looking pretty throughout the year is a difficult task and needs a bit of planning and preparation. Many books and articles have been written on the subject of succession planning, but it’s not really that hard. For example planting a few spring bulbs under a shrub or perennial is one easy way of providing a longer period of interest. You can still lift and divide your snowdrops if you are quick, they prefer to be moved ‘in the green’ and will spread more quickly if you give them a helping hand. They grow well in grass as well as borders.\r\n\r\nNow is the time to plan for a late summer show. Sow a few annuals such as Cosmos; its not too late and they come up really quick. You can then plant them out in the gaps left by earlier flowering perennials such as oriental poppies. Tobacco plants will do the same job and they come in  wide range of sizes and colours, I’ve ordered some plug plants by mail order.  Cut the poppies hard back first, they will survive and grow fresh new leaves. If you have successfully overwintered dahlia tubers, get them off to a good start by planting them in some compost and give them a little heat. When all risk of frost is over and they have started to grow leaves, you can pop them in for a long summer and autumn show as long as you feed and water them well. \r\n\r\nOther combinations which work well and are easy:\r\n\r\n•\tPrimroses planted among herbaceous peonies – the emerging red peony stems set off the pale yellow flowers really well.\r\n•\tThe smaller daffodils such as ‘Hawera’ among beefier plants such as day lilies or hardy geraniums. The Day Lily will grow over and so hide the fading daffodil leaves.\r\n•\tA clematis growing through a wall trained shrub such as firethorn. We’ve a large, white flowered clematis doing just that. It contrasts well with the small, dense canopy of (the rather boring) firethorn leaves.\r\n•\tSpring bulbs such as wood anemones which flower for ages and look lovely in a woodland setting with Hostas or Gunnera both of which tend to come into leaf rather late. Soak the anenomes for a few hours before planting and give them some leafmould if you have it.\r\n•\tThe bronze leaved celandine,  ‘brazen hussy’ hugs the ground, spreading like mad so needs a bit of a careful eye on it.  The bright yellow flowers contrast beautifully with its dark leaves in Spring, but it is not for the faint hearted gardener who likes soft colours!  The whole plant dies back by midsummer, so it is good to let it run through later performing shrubs and perennials.\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m writing this mid April in a slight panic as we open the garden to the public in 2 weeks’ time. So thank you in anticipation to those of you who took the time to visit.  We are open again in June, so hope to see you then when ‘Charnwood’ will be in her summer dress!\r\n"},
{"nid":"34","title":"Creating a meadow","type":"blog","created":"1279466788","body_value":"A bout 3 years ago we decided to have a go at creating a small meadow in the garden. I love wildflowers, and the thought of a colourful tapestry of grasses and native plants swaying in the breeze on a sunny day seemed just a few months away.  Just stop mowing and wait. Wrong, as usual!\r\n\r\nRecently I visited Great Dixter, Christopher Lloyds garden  on the Surrey\/Sussex border. Christo  died a while back, but his head gardener, Fergus Garrett has carried on the good work  and the garden is looking as lovely as ever. As part of the visit, Fergus explained to us how they created a meadow. I wish I heard it before I went down what seemed like a fairly quick and easy path!  This is how to create that fabulous meadow:\r\n\r\n•\tRemove all top growth when mowing, you need poor soil for wildflowers to flourish and win over the lush grass\r\n•\tIf the soil is too good, yellow rattle is a semi parasitic plant that will see off the grass, but be careful, it spreads like mad\r\n•\tMow in August  after all the plants have set and deposited seed for next year  and the dragonflies have done their thing\r\n•\tIf you have spring bulbs planted in your meadow, mow again late winter so you don’t damage them when in flower or leaf and you can see them properly when they come up \r\n•\tBe patient – Fergus said that it takes about 7 years to establish at Great Dixter.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, our meadow is coming on. We now have a small patch of ox eye daisies, wild sweet peas, periwinkle,  stitchwort and geraniums, as well as buttercups and clover. In spring there are English bluebells and we have planted a tree peony, a black stemmed bamboo and a species rose to add a bit of height and interest. At Dixter they had huge numbers of green winged orchids which looked absolutely lovely so I’m on a mission to find seeds of that. So who knows – perhaps in another 4 years it will pass muster!\r\n\r\nThanks once again for those of you who paid our garden a visit this year. We have raised a huge sum for charity and enjoyed sharing ‘Charnwood’ with people who really appreciate the work we have put in. As I write this we are getting ready for our opening in June, so as you read it we will be having a rest from gardening, feet up, wine in hand, completely oblivious to the weeds all around us!\r\n"},
{"nid":"35","title":"Getting the garden ready for winter","type":"blog","created":"1318952451","body_value":"It can be a sad, grey month, October. The clocks change, giving us less time in the evening to get outside and the weather isn’t conducive to lovely suppers on the patio with a glass of wine. But we gardeners can look on the brighter side; getting the garden ready for winter has a kind of end of season satisfaction about it. After all, it is the time to plan for next year and if we get it right we can look forward to a great display in 2012. Even if we get it wrong there is fun in filling the gap with a new purchase next spring.\r\n\r\nPlanting bulbs in pots or straight into the garden is so easy – just plant them twice their depth and the pointy side up. Job done. One of my favourite bits of our garden last year was a tall pot filled with big, blousy tulips and a few forget me not seedlings I gently relocated from one of my flower beds. It only took 5 minutes to plant up, but was pretty for weeks. Keeping the wildlife from eating bulbs is a huge preoccupation here. Mice love to eat crocus bulbs and squirrels munch happily on tulips, the more expensive the better. Last year I soaked them in tonic water with quinine and it worked to some extent. They are supposed to dislike the bitterness, I’ll certainly try it again this time. Alliums are worth their weight in gold in the garden. They bring height, structure and a gorgeous splash of colour to the early summer garden; one of the best and earliest is ‘Purple Sensation’. They seed about when happy and the seed heads look lovely. As they are a member of the onion family, nothing eats them either, result!\r\n\r\nOrnamental grasses have been beautiful this year at ‘Charnwood’, surviving the drought really well. Some look good well into October including a tall Miscanthus with stripy leaves and deep purple flowerheads that turn the most vibrant Autumn colours. The time to plant or divide them is in spring when they have started to regrow, so I’m planning to do just that next year. They are such graceful, easy plants, giving an ethereal quality to the border. Another favourite is Molina ‘Skyracer’. It grows big, as you would expect from its name, with very tall (around 2 metres) but dainty flowerheads. Grasses look especially good in association with small flowered plants, such as michaelmas daises, catmint, verbena bonariensis or phlox. This is sometime referred to as ‘prairie style planting’ and if you are a Gardeners World fan, you will have seen on the TV the astonishingly beautiful Millennium garden at Penshurst last month. The chief advocate and expert in prairie planting is Piet Oudolf who was also featured. I can heartily recommend his books if you want inspiration or a good gift.\r\n\r\nI’m not taking any chances this year given how much we lost last winter. As soon as the dahlias suffer the first frost, they will be dug up and overwintered in a cool place where I can keep an eye on them. Cuttings are already taken of plants not reliably hardy and tender perennials such as melianthus, agapanthus and gunneras will be given a good, deep mulch. Cordylines will be gently tied up in a bunch to protect their crowns. Acers and other prize plants in pots are in a sheltered place where the frost and cold winds can’t do their worst. This time I’ll be ready!\r\n"},
{"nid":"36","title":"Planting trees","type":"blog","created":"1321631552","body_value":"If the weather forecast is anyway near accurate, we may all be up to our necks in snow by now. Writing this mid October, it is very hard to imagine as there are parts of the garden that could fool you into thinking it’s June. One little group Charnwood includes is a pink English Rose, several spikes of a rich blue delphininum, some green tobacco plant ‘Lansdorfii’ and tall pink Cosmos. \r\n\r\nA tree can transform your garden, and November can be a good month for planting deciduous trees and shrubs, as long as a frost is not forecast. Bare root trees are cheaper and easier to transport, so a good alternative to the rather expensive pot grown specimens you tend to get in garden centres. Smaller trees tend to get established easier and more quickly than bigger ones. Soak the tree well for at least an hour before you plant. The latest research has found that the ground should be well cultivated, but no compost or fertiliser added. Cultivate the ground well to around 1.5 metres across, but no deeper than the rootball as most roots grow sideways and not downwards. You can buy ‘friendly’ funghi now from garden centres that encourages root growth. Don’t plant too low, or the tree will ‘settle’ and have difficulty breathing.  Tease out the roots gently, make sure it’s upright and facing the right way in the planting hole and backfill thoroughly, firm in well and give it proper support, hammered well in to the ground away from the roots and facing into the prevailing wind so it survives the winter gales. Water really well and give it a mulch of shredded bark or leaf mould. Keep it well watered for at least the first year. My favourite trees include the willow leaved pear, Pyrus salicifolia ‘Pendula’ and the dwarf Fuji cherry Prunus incisa ’Kojo-no-mai’. Both have lovely spring blossom and the cherry gorgeous autumn colours. \r\n\r\nTwo of my usual ‘nags’ at this time of year – it’s not too late to plant tulips, and gather up your leaves to make leafmould. I’ve planted up some pots of the lovely lily flowered tulips; they are so elegant and come in gorgeous colours to suit any colour scheme. I’ve decided to be a bit more subtle this year, and have gone for ‘White Triumphator’ underplanted with forget me nots. I soaked the bulbs in tonic water with quinine last year and it seemed to stop the squirrels munching them to some extent, so I’ve done it again. \r\n\r\nMaking leaf mould is dead easy – put fallen damp leaves in a big plastic bag, tie the top, stab a few holes in the bottom with a fork and dump them behind the shed. In a year, or maybe two, you will have beautiful dark, crumbly compost, all for free. Plants that enjoy a mulch of this include lilies, hellebores and any woodland plant. If you mow the leaves off your lawn, the combination of them all chopped up with grass clippings composts really well and more quickly.\r\n"},
{"nid":"37","title":"Works of art in the garden","type":"blog","created":"1324223811","body_value":"Sometimes a plant just won’t do it; it’s too dry, the season is too short, or it would simply look wrong. But a focal point is needed, or perhaps a little ‘something else’ to add some interest to a neglected corner. What do you do? \r\n\r\nI use the phrase ‘a work of art’ ‘to cover any inanimate but decorative object in the garden (not counting your snoozing spouse, of course). So it could be a lump of wood, a mirror, a group of pebbles or shells, or an actual statue. You can add drama, humour, or all year round interest in this way and it can cost a lot or very little. Some ideas that work well at Charnwood:\r\n\r\n•\tShells and pebbles in the ‘seaside garden’ to encourage memories of beach holidays;\r\n•\ta hare in the long grass in the ‘meadow’;\r\n•\ta woodpecker in the stumpery;\r\n•\ta sunbathing frog; and getting more expensive and unusual...\r\n•\t.. a punk made out of sewage pipe (yes, I’m serious, see picture).\r\n\r\nAs well as filling that gap, they also make good Christmas presents. A stroll round your favourite garden centre should give you some inspiration, but if not, a ‘google search’ will come up with endless possibilities. Have a look at: http:\/\/www.mirabilisdesign.co.uk\/index.html or http:\/\/www.crocus.co.uk\/products\/_\/outdoor\/ornaments\/prcid.75\/\r\n\r\nIf you want a book for a gift, you really are spoilt for choice. Cleve West’s ‘Our Plot’ is a beautifully written and observed book about allotments ‘where lives have been enriched by the simple act of growing food’. Jayne Thompson tells the charming story of her long time running of the Tollerton School Gardening Club with some creative hints and tips in ‘Little Green Fingers’ and, at £3.50 from the post office, it is an easy and cheap stocking filler. If you are a Monty Don fan (why wouldn’t you be?), ‘The Ivington Diaries’ is a month by month collection of his writing.  Now Christopher Lloyd has sadly left us, I think Monty is by far and away the best garden writer around. A few words from his entry on 6 April 1998:\r\n\r\n‘Cherries are sky flowers really. The trees exist only to hold the blossoms up in the air, and to elaborate on their form is an unnecessary embellishment. Of course, this imposes constraints on your life. To have the sublime pleasure of putting your head in the flower-clouds you must be around when they flower.

{"nid":"75","title":"Roses out now - 3 of the best","type":"blog","created":"1339533460","body_value":"Such a lovely time in the garden, not only is it looking good despite the weather, but there is so much more to come.\r\n\r\nThree of my all time favourite roses are out now:  from right to left - modern climbing rose 'Laura Ford', Climber Mme Alfred Carriere and Gallica rose 'Tuscany Superb'.\r\n\r\nLaura Ford is an easy, short climber to around 10'. Its smallish but abundant flowers start as bright yellow buds and then open,  fading with a hint of pink. It is at it's best now, but does repeat flower given a good soak and a feed. The scent is lovely, not too overpowering. \r\n\r\nMme Alfred Carriere is a more robust climber, to 20' here. Lovely ivory white, good scent, happy on a quite exposed wall. Fabulous show this year, repeat flowers a little, but sporadically.\r\n\r\nTuscany Superb is an amazing, velvety, blousy, very beautiful rose. Gangly plant, no repeat flowers, but who cares, it is so beautiful. I have it in a bed closely planted with hardy geraniums, foxgloves and regale lillies, lavender at the front. Not radical, but very lovely and fragrant, makes me happy.\r\n\r\nI like roses in small groups in mixed borders rather than a bed to themselves. They work better for me that way as its easier to mask them when they are not at their best which, after all, is a fair proportion of the year. Plant spring bulbs under them and perennials to scramble round them, keep them well fed and watered and you will enjoy your garden from spring into late autumn.\r\n\r\n"},

{"nid":"49","title":"Seed sowing for summer","type":"blog","created":"1328180566","body_value":"Hello winter! I thought it would never arrive. Some days in the garden in December and early January felt more like early spring – birds singing, bulbs coming through, no coat. I was weeding, mulching, pruning and trying not to get lulled into a false sense of security. It was great to be out and doing proper gardening in the middle of winter (I was even spreading mushroom compost on Christmas Day!), but when the serious and regular frosts arrived it did feel like the natural order of things had returned.  A rather comforting thought now I am well into my middle age. I hope you all got your tender plants safely into the warm before it descended? My little greenhouse is stuffed full of cuttings, dahlia tubers, agave and tender perennials such as agapanthus, salvia and galtonia. \r\n\r\nGazing at the seed catalogues and planning wonderful planting schemes for the summer is one of my favourite winter activities. White Cosmos ‘purity’ is a must: it is a lovely, elegant filler for the border, growing to over a metre in good conditions. Cosmos look lovely mingling with perennials and roses and they flowers for ages. They come in other colours, predominantly in the pink to red range, and they will seed around when happy. Last year I bought some plug plants of a gorgeous tobacco plant so I may try them from seed this year. They too come in a range of colours and heights; some are deliciously fragrant and they seem to look good pretty much everywhere in the garden.  One of the best and most dramatic is Nicotiana sylvestris (pictured) with fantastically scented white flowers; it makes a good dot plant. Like cosmos, tobacco plants are great gap fillers, easy to pop in after the spring bedding plants and bulbs are over. Be warned though, both are beloved by slugs especially when they are little and tender; it is one of the few times I get the slug pellets out. I may even have a go at growing more edible plants as well – I have my eye on an amazing looking Basil called ‘Crimson King’. Aptly named, it has deep purple leaves and is described as having a ‘spicy clove aroma’. I’ll let you know if it lives up to its name and description!\r\n\r\nWe have a new project for 2012. If any of you know where I can get reasonably priced, really big animal sculptures, I would love to hear from you. With luck the next time you visit ‘Charnwood’ (we are open again through the NGS on 6\/7 May) you may think you are on safari. But I’m still working on it! I have also taken the plunge under some pressure from family and friends to embrace some modern technology. So you can now follow me on Twitter at @katescuttings for yet more garden ramblings. There are some real gardeners to follow too, including Monty Don and Chris Beardshaw.\r\n\r\nNext month is a very special one for me. It is 10 years since the first Kate’s Cuttings appeared in this great village newsletter. It has been a pleasure and a privilege to share my rather eclectic gardening thoughts with you – but more on that next month. "},

It was built in the 18th Century, when Moorish Spain was already a distant memory. Its apparently Moorish gardens (see picture) are even more recent, having been designed by the French landscape gardener, Jean Claude Forestier, in 1912. But it is typical of southern spanish gardens and reminded me of the Alhambra, albeit on a much, much smaller scale. Certainly the atmosphere of peace and calm order makes it a good place to be if you need a gentle space in which to reflect.\r\n\r\nCordoba was also a joy - plans to explore this part of Spain again more thoroughly have begun!"},

{"nid":"55","title":"Blimey - it's the 10th anniversary of Kate's Cuttings!","type":"blog","created":"1330595119","body_value":"It is ten years since the following words of mine appeared in our excellent village newsletter in Tollerton:\r\n\r\n‘Call me sad, but I am an obsessive gardener and I have always wanted a gardening column. Don’t get me wrong, I’m no Alan Titchmarsh or Pippa Greenwood but the chance to share my successes (few) and failures (many) with other gardeners and for them to share their experiences with the rest of us seems to me to be a worthwhile and harmless exercise in this increasingly complicated world’.\r\n\r\nIn March 2002 our pond (pictured in 2011) at Charnwood had just been re-sited at the front of the house, we had several tonnes of farmyard manure delivered, I was looking for heron deterrents (no change there) and the ‘south garden’ to the side of the house was being planned. It was the year the Euro was introduced, ‘A Beautiful Mind’ won the Oscar for best film and the winter Olympics had just ended in Salt Lake City. My Dad always used to say that the older you get, the faster time flies, as usual he was right. Ten years – incredible!\r\n\r\nYour response to my humble scribblings has always been marvellous and very much appreciated, thank you. To mark this auspicious anniversary I am working on a book of edited ‘Kate’s Cuttings’, beautifully illustrated by Kevin Pyke’s gorgeous photographs of Charnwood through the seasons, many of the phtots on this website are his. All being well it will be on sale when we open the garden through the NGS this year on the afternoons of 6 and 7 May.  More on that next month.\r\n\r\nAs I write this mid February there is snow on the ground. But the garden still provides some cheer – snowdrops, winter aconites, a variegated holly and the evergreen Viburnum tinus ‘Eve Price’ all look good.  The Viburnum smells lovely, to me of nutmeg. I pop a few bulbs in pots in the greenhouse each autumn to bring them on a bit and to lift the spirits early in the year and a tete a tete daffodil has just come into flower. This is one of the best early dwarf daffodils; it increases happily and looks good in almost any setting. I have it in generous clumps between some clipped box at the front of the house and it lasts for ages unlike some of the grander, more ornamental varieties. Don’t forget that if you buy pots of spring bulbs, daffodils, hyacinth or crocus for the house, you can plant them out in the garden after they have flowered. Cut the dead flower off, give it a good water and a feed if you have some handy and plant it twice the depth of the bulb, perhaps in a bare patch of soil under a shrub; with luck it will delight you for years.\r\n\r\nThank you once again for reading this blog: there is no way I would still be writing it if it were not for your kind words and encouragement. And remember, your garden is there for you to enjoy so don’t worry about a few weeds or an untidy hedge. In the words of the incomparable Derek Jarman: ‘If a garden isn’t shaggy, forget it’. \r\n\r\nHappy gardening!\r\n"},
{"nid":"56","title":"Snowdrops - do we split and re-plant 'in the green'?","type":"blog","created":"1331055615","body_value":"I've just spent a lovely day in the garden digging up big clumps of snowdrops and re-planting them in bare patches of soil to get a bigger, better show next year. I put a load among my hostas as I don't move them around often, they are late to come through and they don't seem to mind the intrusion.\r\n\r\nGarden wisdom has always, to my knowledge at least, told us that we should do this at this time of year. But recent research now argues against it. Not suprising really; to dig up a bulb that has just flowered and expect it to carry on thriving straight after you've stuck it back in the ground is a big ask. But it does seem to work, and has the added advantage of being able to see where the gaps are you need to plant them in. If, like me, you've got thousands of them all over the garden, how do you know where they are to dig up when they are dormant? If they take a couple of years to settle down again, does it really matter? So I will stick with the old ways.\r\n\r\n'February Gold' daffodils(pictured today) are just coming out - we have big clumps in the back garden at Charnwood. It's a gorgeous, easy variety, last ages and is natural looking and not too ornamental if that's your style. 'February Silver' is also there, it comes out a little later. Softer colour, but also lovely. Presumably whovever named them lives in a warmer area than here! Suppose 'March Gold' doesn't have the same ring to it?"},

I've just counted 13 varieties of daffodils out and more to come. Five of the best, smaller varieties are pictured, from the top left:\r\n\r\nJenny - creamy white perianth (outside) and soft yellow cup (middle), so pretty and tasteful, lovely in our woodland setting.\r\nJetfire - a bit on the brash side for me I thought as I like my daffs fairly gentle and 'natural' looking -  orange cup - noooooo. But I read that this was one of Christopher Lloyds favourites so I gave it a go - he was dead right as usual. It manages to be bright and elegant at the same time, a perky kind of daff that will make you smile.\r\nIce Follies - bigger, standing at around 15\" but soft colours, reminds me of lemon sorbet. Really, really lovely at the moment in the little orchard.The soft yellow cup gently fades to white.\r\nFebruary Silver - not as common as her sister, February Gold, but just as pretty, she flowers a little later but they make a good companions nevertheless, especially if planted in generous clumps of the same variety. Naturalises well, dead easy, we've had untouched FS and FG in our back lawn for years.\r\nTete a Tete (bottom row) - the smallest in the list, at about 9\" - great for rockeries, a neat, long lasting variety.\r\n\r\nDeadhead and feed them after flowering, don't cut the leaves down or tie them up, let them die naturally.

I have kept the dahlias fairly dry and frost free over the winter, so they are looking fine and dandy now and ready to come to life.I chopped off all the slimy or mouldy looking bits before planting, if they are bit shrivelled they will probably be OK after a few waterings. I have two old favourites, Bishop of Llandaff (pictured) a really elegant plant with bronze, ferny leaves and gorgeous bright red flowers, and David Howard -  taller, also with bronze leaves but with orange flowers. I've also popped some into pots to sell on our NGS open day on 6 and 7 May.\r\n\r\nI left some in the ground last autumn with a good, protective mulch so will be hoping for some green shoots soon! Slugs love dahlia leaves, especially when young so it's good to keep an eye out for the little critters. A good handful of grit round the emerging shoots usually helps if you are not keen on using slug pellets, this treatment  can work for many plants including delphiniums and hostas which are emerging about now, here in the midlands at least."},

These are such generous plants, they flower and flower all through the summer and into the autumn. One of the best is 'Firebird' - the colour of crushed raspberries. Also Blackbird (pictured) - gorgeous pink\/purple flowers, quite tall for a penstemon at around 90cm, but absolutely beautiful. I have it with Rose' Tuscany Superb, a similar colour and  a gorgeous, fragrant companion. There is a bird theme going on here you may have noticed, Raven is another good variety. They tend to be in the pink\/purple colour scheme so fit well in most borders.\r\n\r\nPenstemons are dead easy from cuttings in late summer, but worth a try at almost any time of year. They are reputed to be a bit tender, but they survive in our midlands garden through all but the worst winters. If you cut them hard back about now to young growth at the base they will stay young and vigorous and flower well. They tend to run out of steam after 3 or 4 years, but hey, so would I if I performed that well!\r\n\r\n"},

Nutmegii doesn't sound as good, I'll admit.\r\n\r\nDead easy, this plant in a sheltered spot. Needs no pruning unless it gets out of hand, but it will want some strong support, especially when it gets to this size.

{"nid":"65","title":"Beetles and cherry trees","type":"blog","created":"1333378611","body_value":"I’m designating April as beetle alert month; especially two that are currently the most destructive in my garden, the red lily beetle and the viburnum one. Both do loads of damage unless you get on their case early. The red lily beetle is unmistakable and aptly named; bright, bright scarlet. If you don’t eliminate them they will munch your lilies until they are soggy brown heaps.  They will then will bonk their mates on your remaining lilies in front of your very eyes, reproduce, and then their offspring will also nosh the leaves. The larvae look really yukky, like bird droppings. So remove and dispose of pdq! Be careful, they are good at dropping to the floor and disappearing. The knack to getting the devils I find is to put your hand underneath and shake them gently into it.  I’ve ordered some regale lilies: they are still my favourite and you can keep an eye on them a bit more in a pot, or at least that’s my plan. Then soil will be fresh and not larvae infested - at first at least! Bear in mind that lilies like good drainage, so a few handfuls of grit or leaf mould in the compost will keep them happy.\r\n\r\nLily beetles will also eat other members of the lily family such as snakeshead fritillaries, so keep a sharp watch out for the little critters.\r\n\r\nViburnum beetle will turn your precious bushes into manky brown affairs, sometimes very quickly. Have  at least a weekly check during the spring for signs of feeding on the new foliage and cut out the brown bits back to a leaf or bud and burn the affected foliage . If it’s getting out of control, spray it – garden centres will have something suitable  in stock now. There are both chemical and organic controls for this. The best time to spray is when the newly hatched larvae are feeding on the new foliage from now to early May. Treatment in mid-summer is really too late as the worst of the damage has already been done.\r\nOn a more positive note, the dwarf Japanese cherry (Prunus incisa Kojo-no-mai) is just coming into flower -pictured. It is absolutely gorgeous, almond pink blossom on bare, twiggy, curly stems. It has gently grown to about 3 metres here in 15 years, a fabulous tree for a small garden, good autumn leaf colour too. As you may have gathered if you read this column regularly, I have written a little book made up of ‘Kate’s Cuttings’ and this tree is featured in the chapter ‘Five easy but beautiful trees’. The book is wonderfully illustrated by Kevin Pyke’s gorgeous photos. It will be on sale, all being well, when we have our garden open days for charity on the afternoons of 6 and 7 May. If you are very lucky Kevin and I will be around to sign one for you!\r\n\r\nIt’s going to be a dry summer by the look of it. So do what you can to conserve water – mulch your borders after it’s rained to prevent evaporation, plant up a few big pots rather than lots of little ones, they stay damp for longer, and plant drought loving plants such as sedum and bulbous iris. I’m one to talk, I love my ferns and other woodland plants, but being realistic I may have to rethink some of my planting. Hey, ho, there are worse things, aren’t there? Hope to see you on 6 or 7 May!\r\n"},

Their colours sing out at this time of year when everything is so green and fresh. I'll have a go at naming the ones pictured, but to be honest I don't really care what variety they are, they are all lovely and so easy. The only problem we have at Charnwood is that the squirrels eat them, so I soak them in tonic water with quinine first, they are not supposed to like the taste and it works to some extent.This year  I have also tried planting them in pots with smelly alliums, that seems to have worked too, although I'm not sure if they will flower together as intended! The advantage of planting them in pots is that you can give them the well drained soil they like, and you can move them round to where you want them and out of the way when done. I usually pop them into a border after they have flowered and died down a bit, they often come up again next year, albeit with smaller flowers. In fact all the ones pictured are in beds here with a  bit of grit dug in to lighten the heavy clay and they come up reasonably reliably every year, although I do add to them if I remember and manage to plant them in the right place.\r\n\r\nHere goes, but please don't quote me, from left to right: Little Princess, White Dream, Van de Neer.

This is also the date and venue for the ‘Kate’s Cuttings’ book launch. Kevin Pyke,  who took the most beautiful photos of the garden throughout the year for illustration, and I will both be around to sign your new purchase; how can you miss that?! A donation from the sale of every book will go to the Friends of Tollerton School, so it is all in aid of good causes.\r\n\r\nThe daffodils have put on a fantastic show this year. My favourite (I think!) is ‘Thalia’ (see picture by Kevin) – a really elegant, long lasting white narcissus that mingles beautifully with the bluebells under our weeping pears.  ‘Hawera’ is smaller and very dainty, it flowers quite late, even into May and is so pretty but rather apt to disappear. ‘February Gold’ is hugely reliable, although tends to flower in March despite it’s name. We have a big group on the back lawn that increases steadily and flowers come what may. ‘February Silver’ appears a couple of weeks later and, as the name suggests, is a paler, more ethereal cousin. ‘Tête à tête’ is small enough to look good on a rockery or at the front of the border; also at its best here in March this year.  If you go to the katescuttings.net website you can see more daffodil pictures and descriptions as well as my regular blog about what is going in here in the garden and how to get hold of the book.\r\n\r\nNew to ‘Charnwood’ this year is our jungle hut. We had an old sycamore cut down as it was smothered in ivy and getting dangerously unsafe and a gap appeared. The obvious solution – to me at least - was the hut and, now it is nearly finished and looks perfect in its woodland setting. I’m now searching out jungley plants to make it feel at home. Check out http:\/\/mad-hutter.co.uk for the fab new company who made it.\r\n\r\nMy proudest purchase so far is a clematis ‘serratifolia’, a member of the tangutica group that includes our native ‘orange peel’ clematis with yellow flowers and fluffy seedheads. It claims to be scented. So I have visions of sipping my Pimms in the jungle hut late in the summer with a citrus-like perfume (as it says on the label) wafting in the air. Fingers crossed! \r\n"},

Also a huge thank to our many loyal friends and family who helped out so cheerfully despite the damp!\r\n\r\nThe stars of the garden were 2 large pots of  'Burgundy' lily flowered tulips, at their peak in the little courtyard on the day and the new Jungle Hut.\r\n\r\nIn total we raised around a thousand pounds for charity, so it was well worth the work. Peter and I are now enjoying a gardening free week. At least that's the plan, although I think I see a gap needing a little plant popping in.....\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos from left to right: Burgundy tulips, jungle hut www.mad-hutter.co.uk and the stumpery, all taken at 'Charnwood' on 6 May 2012."},

If it was white only, it would look like a bad accident between a meringue lorry and a milk float, messy, frothy, indistinct, we've all seen them. Box and artemisia as well as the lovely brick paths set off the lilies, roses and other beautifully grown plants to make for an atmosphere of elegance and serenity at Sissinghurst some of us try to create in our gardens.\r\n\r\nAt Charnwood in April, the lovely willow leaved pear, white, green and grey are all together in one plant and make for a subtle but stunning combination that many of our garden visitors comment on. Underplanted with white daffodils and bluebells in the spring green grass, the planting scheme works well, albeit for a short time.\r\n\r\nGrey and green will set off many colours. Our long back border here was, unitl recently, full of deep purple tulips 'Van de Neer' which looked good and being sturdy fairly short stemmed bulbs stood upright among stachys and emerging  leaves of perennials and foxgloves. Next will come penstemons, peonies, poppies, iris, artemisia 'valierie finnis', several varieties of euphorbia, and others I've forgotten for now!\r\n\r\nPictures from left to right: Tulip Van de Neer, Thalia daffs and buebells under the willow leaved pears and a view of the back border.

Looking really lovely now are the really long racemes (more than 1m, showing off now) of one I bought as Macrobotrytis (sp?) but I believe has been renamed something else? The overall effect is soft and filigree, the colour gentle. The white one has the best scent, it is almost overpowering about now, early evening.\r\n\r\nPeter prunes them all back really hard, to 2 or 3 buds in January or February, leaving an almost scupltural framework of branches tied to strong wires. He has another prune in summer to keep it under control - these are vigorous plants to say the least so he ends up with a big pile of trimmings. My contribution is to throw a few spades of bonfire ash on as a mulch in early spring to encourage bud formation and to sit under them when in flower, appreciate their loveliness  and drink wine, all these things I have a lot of experience of."},
{"nid":"74","title":"What is the 'June gap' and how can we fill it?","type":"blog","created":"1338559633","body_value":"When gardeners talk about the ‘June gap’ I am a bit puzzled. If you have a reasonable range of bulbs, perennials and shrubs in your garden, you should have some colour throughout the spring and summer months, shouldn’t you? I’m guessing that the phrase came from a Local Authority Parks Department that relied solely on bedding plants to provide a good display; when the polyanthus and tulips are over they get ripped out to make space for the geraniums and lobelia that don’t start to spread and look decent for at least a month.\r\n\r\nNot that I dislike so-called bedding plants, even in a more natural garden border setting. If you pop them in gentle drifts in the gaps in your borders they look lovely. This year I’ve grown cosmos, which are really easy to grow from seed; last year it was tobacco plants. Their huge advantage is that, if you deadhead and give them a little feed, they will flower from late spring until Christmas if the weather stays reasonably mild. I love my herbaceous perennials, but very few of them are in flower for more than a couple of months.\r\n\r\nOne perennial at its best at Charnwood in June is the Delphinium.  Its name has an exotic origin, ‘delphis’ is Greek for dolphin, which describes the shape of the flowers. My favourite is D. 'Black Knight' with dark, purpley blue flowers. You can get pink and white ones too, but that is tampering with nature for me. Delphiniums like rich fertile well drained soil so I dig plenty of compost into our borders and they grow well. If you cut them down hard immediately after flowering, pop in a cosmos to fill the gap for a bit and give them a feed and water; they will flower again in September. Put a cane in for support around April and watch out for slugs, especially when they emerge in spring. The best place to get well grown delphiniums locally and at a reasonable price is Moores on the Melton Road.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to those of you who came to our open garden last month. We had 273 visitors and made over £1100 for charity. People even came in the rain on the BH Monday – gardeners are such generous and hardy folk! Thank you, too, to the Tollerton resident who wrote so eloquently in praise of this column in a letter in last month’s newsletter. If s\/he would like to see lily beetles ‘in action’, feel free to pay us a call at ‘Charnwood’. And if the Parish Council would like a more colourful (but possibly less accurate) write up of one of their meetings I would be happy to oblige!\r\n\r\nDon’t forget the Garden Club plant stall at the Village Event, it is always really good and excellent value for money. I will be selling my books at the event to, based on this column and beautifully illustrated by Kevin Pyke’s photos.  There are more details about that and our next garden study day here on 7 July on the website; we regularly post a blog and pictures of Charnwood too.  Don’t forget to appreciate your garden this summer: we work hard all year to make it look good, so take the time out to enjoy it!\r\n"},
{"nid":"76","title":"Self seeders - friend or foe?","type":"blog","created":"1341060901","body_value":"To answer that question I can do no better than quote Christopher Lloyd from his great book 'Succession planting for adventurous gardeners':\r\n\r\n'Self-sowing plants plug gaps with relaxed abandon and are a great help in keeping the show going, as long as you treat them as allies that need to be controlled'.\r\n\r\nIf you are a gardener who likes it all very, very  neat, than they are probably not for you. But if, like me, you like a more relaxed and blousy kind of planting with no bare soil throughout the growing season then they are to be recommended.\r\n\r\nThe obvious easy candidate is the humble forget me not. Lovely in May to cover the ground under spring bulbs such as tulips and later daffodils. I saw a gorgeous, rich combinaiton  at Great Dixter a couple of years ago: a deep, mauvey-pink forget me not with 'Red Shine' tulips. You absolutely could not ignore that planting!\r\n\r\nSelf sowers can form a kind of theme running through your borders to give a bit of continuity and gentle grace. Some of the plants we use for this are Welsh poppies in spring, opium poppies and alliums in early summer and Verbena bonariensis from late June onwards. They are all good mixers, provde valuable succession and, as long as we make sure they don't smother their neighbours, they add real charm and colour.\r\n\r\nThe best way of nurturing them is to get down to soil level on your knees with a trowel in early spring; if you thin them out fairly ruthlessly then  they will have space to develop and do their thing. I try and leave around a foot in between forget me nots or they will quickly become congested and then mildewy. Biennuals such as foxgloves, verbascum and sweet williams are bigger and  need more space, they take two years to germinate and flower so patience is required! Alliums self seed freely but can take a while for the bulbs to reach flowering size. We have them mingling with grasses where their tatty, pongy foliage  disappears under the miscanthus leaves but the allium seedheads remain and look good for a month or more.\r\n\r\nBear in mind it's hard to make a garden entirely out of self sowers. Unless you are looking for a really chaotic meadow effect that is. \r\n\r\nPhotos from left to right: Allium christophii, opium poppy and sweet william all in flower here at 'Charnwood' at the end of June 2012\r\n\r\n"},
{"nid":"77","title":"Taking cuttings and details of study day at Charnwood 7 July","type":"blog","created":"1341229521","body_value":"Now is a good time of year to take cuttings from many plants. Penstemons are one of the easiest: take out a strong growing non flowering shoot about 4 “ long and cut cleanly below a leaf. Carefully remove the bottom leaves and put several of them around the edge of a pot full of gritty compost to ensure good drainage.  Get the pot ready first so you can put them straight in and keep them well watered and misted. If they dry out they won’t grow roots and will shrivel and die. Some folk cover them with a poly bag, but I don’t: I like to keep an eye on them and I find they can soon rot. If they wilt at first don’t panic, they will recover in a couple of days if you look after them.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks, you should see little white roots coming out of the bottom of the pot. That is the time to grow them on individually until they are big enough to plant out. Many perennials and some shrubs such as lavender, rosemary, hebes and salvias are all worth a try although it will take longer for some shrubs to root so be patient. It is also a good way of making sure you don’t lose your favourite plant over the winter as salvias and penstemons aren’t the hardiest of plants.  You can pop a small pot in a sheltered place or in the greenhouse until it is safe for them to emerge in spring.\r\n\r\nGarden visiting is a great pastime and there are several open nearby over the summer. One of the best local gardens is at 26 Selby Road, West Bridgford. ‘The Small Exotic Garden’ is in the NGS ‘Yellow Book’. From the outside it looks like a typical suburban garden, privet hedge, red brick semi, but don’t be fooled. Walk round the back and you are met with an absolutely perfect jungle, beautifully planted for fantastic foliage effect. Opens 29 July and 5 August 11-4. \r\n\r\n17 Main Street, Keyworth is open from 1-5 on 15 July. Quite a different kind of garden and much bigger, it has several different areas to mooch around with lovely beech and yew hedges, a secret rose garden and a spacious orchard at the back. It also has a good plant stall and does teas – good plants and cake, what more could you want on a summer afternoon apart from some decent weather?  A bit further afield The University of Nottingham Gardens open on 19 August – 300 acres so lots of variety. My favourite bit is the walled garden, full of exotic planting. Perhaps you can spot my current passion? \r\n\r\nIf you want a garden day out with a difference, I’m doing an informal study day I’m calling ‘Get down to earth with Kate’ on 7 July, 10.30 to 3pm. Come to Charnwood and I will walk with you round the garden, give you tips on what looks good together, how to keep colour going throughout the spring and summer, and answer your questions.

But I have learned both by trial and error and through reading colour experts such as Christopher Lloyd and Sarah Raven that if you get too carried away, it can look more like a dogs dinner than a great planting combo. So, how do you do it?\r\n\r\nThe answer, my gardening friends, is the generous use of foliage. Plant plenty of green, grey or red leaved plants and any planting scheme is much more likely to work. You can get away with really so called clashing colours if you keep a balance between vibrant flowers and calming green leaves. And don't forget that foliage can look good and provide contrast on its own - perennials such as alchemilla mollis, ferns and  and hostas can look fab together without any help from more their more obvious-and-brash-flowering cousins. Especially if you mix different leaf shapes such as chunky hostas and lacey ferns or corydalis.\r\n\r\nFrom left to right a contrast of colour and form with flowers playing second fiddle: a medley of green - hosta, fern and ladys mantle; Cotinus 'Grace and ladys mantle; Lychnis 'firecracker' and phlomis, Lychnis and a grey leaved achillea. \r\n"},
{"nid":"80","title":"Will 'Charnwood' be a media star yet?","type":"blog","created":"1343849622","body_value":"It has been an interesting week at Charnwood. A few weeks ago we got a telephone call from the BBC asking us if they could come and film the garden for East Midlands Today. Fortunately Peter took the call, I would probably have assumed it was a mate taking the mick.\r\n\r\nAnyway, they came one morning in mid July, three of them; a producer, cameraman and Ady Dayman, their gardening correspondent. All three were absolutely charming, very professional and great fun. They spent almost four hours here filming – by now you may have seen my 30 seconds of fame! It was a really interesting experience seeing them at work.  I now understand how important continuity is and what it involves, and how the weather can mess up the best laid plans. What they did do was give the book a good plug – if you don’t know about it yet, it is now available; details are on the www.katescuttings.net website.\r\n\r\nWe have all moaned and worried about the wet weather, but one thing it has done is helped young trees to get properly established. Our really heavy clay makes it hard for young plants to really thrive, however much we try to improve the drainage. The catalpa, golden birch , ferns and acers all look better than they have ever looked and roses and clematis have loved the rain. I know it must have been horrid for folk who have been flooded, or who’s crops have been wrecked, but from where I garden it’s not been a wholly bad season. My biggest job has been to stop the garden looking like a jungle. I like bold, exuberant planting, but there are limits even for me! The bamboo must now be 6 metres high and some of the grasses and inulas are towering way over my head. I may need to get the machete out!\r\n\r\nOver the summer keep deadheading your annuals and give them a feed so they keep flowering. Lavender benefits from a good shear back now to keep it young and neat. Hardy geraniums, delphiniums and alchemilla mollis that have flowered and are looking a bit messy can be cut back to the ground, they will throw up new, fresh leaves and may flower again. September is a good time to rejuvenate your earlier flowering perennials such as brunnera, heuchera, pulmonaria and daylilies. Dig them up, fork over the soil and add some compost. Throw the woody, congested middle bits onto the compost heap and replant generous clumps of the best, new bits from the outside with plenty of roots and water well for a bit. Next year, or possibly the year after they will reward you with much more vigorous growth and more flowers. You can divide your bulbous iris in August, don’t replant too deep and dig in plenty of grit, they prefer well drained soil and sun. \r\n\r\nOn September 8th we are running another fun packed garden day here at Charnwood with a  home cooked lunch, tickets are £28. For details give me a ring, email me, or check out the website. In the meantime, don’t forget to relax and enjoy your garden.

They mix really well with most plants and flower and flower, some from June until the frosts if you deadhead regularly and give them a feed. They are really easy from cuttings and late August is a good time to take them. Take a non flowering shoot if you can about 10\/15 cm, strip off the bottom leaves and put them into a pot of gritty compost. Keep them really damp for a couple of weeks, then water them often and you will get little plants well able to overwinter in a frost free or sheltered place. They should then flower next year.\r\n\r\nIts often said they area bit  tender, but, apart from the very worst of winters, mine have survived here for at least 3 or 4 years. They then tend to get a bit woody and need replacing. Cutting them hard back, almost to the ground, in April, ensures their vigour for a bit longer.\r\n\r\nPictured is Czar, an upright, fairly short penstemon. Blackbird is deep purple, taller, more elegant. Firebird is a great doer, the colour of crushed strawberries, the most generous flowerer here. For those of you who like more subtle colours there is a popular  pink 'Hidcote' and 'Sour Grapes' is a kind of muddy purple (sorry, not my thing, but may be yours!). The white ones and softer colours tend to be more tender in my experience.\r\n\r\n"},
{"nid":"82","title":"The tme to tackle those congested Iris is NOW!","type":"blog","created":"1346167797","body_value":"I'm talking about clumps of tuberous Iris with the lovely big, blousy flowers early on in the Summer. They often come in blue or purple, but if you go to the website at the wonderful Woottens nursery near Southwold in Suffolk  www.woottensplants.co.uk you will see a huge range of gorgeous colours to suit every taste. There is talk of repeat flowering varieties, too.\r\n\r\nNow is the best time to tackle clumps of iris that have become congested and so stopped flowering generously. That happens here about every 3 or 4 years, but it does depend a bit on the variety, soil and situation.The idea is that, if you do it now, the newly planted tubers will have time to settle in and get a reasonable baking to induce good flowers next year. Iris like good, but very well drained soil, a bit of a hard one to pull off. I dig both grit and garden compost in before re-planting, it works well on our heavy clay spoil. They like a sunny spot, not overcrowded by other plants.\r\n\r\nStep 1 - dig up the whole clump and get all the weeds and unwanted plants out. Some folk suggest you should not replant Iris in the same soil again, but in my experience as long as you replenish the soil and have had no problems with disease, it is usually fine to do so. Step 2 - throw away the old and nobbly brown middle with no sign of leaves - see left photo. Keep the younger, more vigorous tubers - middle photo, pop them into a bucket of water to keep them fresh and happy while you prepare the ground, dig it over really thoroughly and add compost and grit if needed. Step 3 - when the new bed is ready for them, carefully check over the plants you have kept, trim off the top of the leaves to stop the autumn gales blowing them out of the ground, plant and water well and carry on doing so until they are established - see photo on right. Don't plant them too deep, the tubers need to feel the sun on their faces to make them want to flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},

{"nid":"85","title":"Ideas for gorgeous trees for small gardens and how to plant them.","type":"blog","created":"1352038356","body_value":"We've some lovely Autumn colour here at Charnwood. The dwarf Japanese Cherry  Prunus incisca 'Kojo-no'mai' is currently gorgeous shades of red and yellow and the Euonymous alatus a stunning ruby colour. Both are little, slow growing trees, so ideal for smaller gardens. Acers are also performing well here and will thrive in a spot sheltered from winds and, depending a bit on the variety,  in fairly acid soil. We also have a medlar, a really trouble free and compact tree with beautiful, simple white flowers in spring and clear yellow leaves in Autumn. They are self fertile, so you don't need to plant more than one to get the rather weird fruit.\r\n\r\nChoosing the right tree is really important, they can add so much to a garden, but conversely cause so much grief and expense if you get it wrong. It really is worth doing a bit of research to see what conditions you will be planting into: soil, aspect, dry or damp, how much space there is and how much time you can give to looking after your newly planted friend. One of my absolute pet hates is to see a tree pruned to look like a neat lollipop, especially when it's natural form is graceful and elegant. Pick the right tree or shrub and let it do it's thing. The RHS website has really good guidance on when and how to prune properly to keep your tree looking good.\r\n\r\nNow is the perfect time to plant a tree, shrub, or hedge. Bare root is probably the best and cheapest way to buy, especially if you are hedge planting or buying in bulk, but you must be able to protect the roots and keep them constantly moist; don't keep them hanging about. Container grown is easier, if usually more expensive. Recent research now suggests that you should not plant trees too deep, their roots grow quite close to the surface so it's best to dig a hole that is about three times as wide as the diameter of the root spread but no deeper than the root ball. There is no need to add compost unless your soil is really poor: in fact the RHS suggest it can be harmful as it leads to the soil settling too much and the tree drowning. Fork over the base of the hole and spread the bare roots out carefully on a small mound of soil, make sure you have the planting depth right by placing a cane across the hole. Firm the soil back in really well with your heel, water copiously and mulch to conserve moisture. Keep the tree really well watered, it can take a couple of seasons at least to get going, especially in our heavy Tollerton soil.\r\n\r\nYou can take hardwood cuttings at this time of year – shrubs that would be good to have a go  with are viburnum, dogwoods, willow and species roses. Dig a little trench in your vegetable garden, put a sharp spade about 15 cm into the soil to make a slit. Cut some sections of healthy growth, about 30cm long,  and nip out the soft tip.  Slide  the cuttings in to about two thirds of their length. Firm the sides of the trench and leave them to get on with it, it may be next spring before you see signs of life. \r\n\r\nNovember can be a gloomy month. Cheer yourself up by browsing the seed catalogues to get some ideas for next year's garden. You can make wonderful plans without getting cold and wet and, who knows, you may even do it!\r\n\r\nPhotos all taken at 'Charnwood' late October to November 2012 from left to right: Prunus incisca 'Kojo-no-mai' over a prostrate juniper; Euonymus alatus; Cornus elegantissima with Berberis' Harlequin'."},

Remind you of anyone?\r\n\r\n‘1001 Gardens You Must See Before You Die’ is bigger, with some great pictures and a fair bit of background for each garden. Although it is expensive it is great value. My kind son bought me 'Mushrooms' by Roger Phillips with over 1,250 photos to help you work out what is edible and what is not. Some fab names: Plantpot dapperling, Greasy Green Brittlegill and Soapy Knight. And there is always a Kate’s Cuttings book at the very reasonable price of £8.50.

Planning ahead is not something we all do well or have time for, but with plants as in most things it really does pay off.\r\n\r\nLift and divide your asters, early this month is better for this group of plants than in the spring. You can see where there are gaps and they will be established and flower well for you next year. This does not apply to everything; for example grasses should be divided in spring or they tend to sulk and die over winter;\r\nPrune climbing roses and tie in stems to prevent them being hit by winter gales;\r\nScarify your lawn, get rid of all that moss and thatch to let light and air in, it's great exercise and cheaper and more fun than going to the gym;\r\nIf you have a cold greenhouse or a light porch, sow winter salads;\r\nPlant spring bulbs, it's a little late for daffodils but not impossible, but this is the best time for tulip planting.

In a years time, or possibly two, you will have beautiful, dark, crumbly compost;\r\nDahlia tubers and Eucomis should by now be stored in a frost free shed. Keep them fairly dry over the winter. If you decide the leave them  in the ground give them a good, thick mulch and hope for kind weather!\r\n\r\n\r\nI love tulips and buy them buy the hundred.  Favourites include the gorgeous and aptly named 'Burgundy', a lily flowered variety that stands tall, elegant and straight  in May; 'Doll's Minuet', beautiful deep pink with green flamed petals also at its best in May, and 'White Triumphator', another lily flowered tulip that, despite its height stands up well to windy wet weather. If you prefer something a bit smaller and daintier perhaps for your rockery in  April,  'Little Princess' is deep orange with a black centre.  All tulips like well drained soil so if your soil is heavy, dig in some grit or plant them in a pot. Lupins and tulips are a well tried and tested combination; the lupin foliage provides a fresh green backdrop to the bright flowers and then grows up to hide the scruffy leaves after they are over. Moores in Stanton usually have well grown, reasonably priced lupins for sale.\r\n\r\n"},

{"nid":"92","title":"Confessions of a compost anorak","type":"blog","created":"1359977747","body_value":"Compost has been on my mind a lot lately. To be honest it often is, I absolutely love the stuff. When we moved to Charnwood in 1987 the soil here was horrible, really dense, heavy clay. Since then we’ve dig tonnes and tonnes of compost in, using it as a mulch as well as to improve the soil. As result, the longer established beds now have good, friable, reasonably well drained soil. Garden compost improves the conditions of the soil as well as it’s nutritional value. We will keep adding it, or it will lose it’s condition.\r\n\r\nI’ve been even more than usually preoccupied with the subject since my kind neighbour gave me a huge pile of well composted horse manure. It is fab stuff, full of those little red, wriggly worms that turn your composted material into gorgeous dark, crumbly stuff over a few months. If you can’t get hold of any for free, you can actually buy worms for compost bins (yes, really!) from www.wigglywigglers.co.uk telephone 01981 500 391. Just make sure you don’t tip them on top of your compost heap or they will end up straight down a robins throat, they adore red worms!\r\n\r\nGetting compost right isn’t rocket science. A mix of dry stuff like paper or cardboard, especially if shredded, is  good mixed with green material such as grass clippings. This time of year I’m tidying my borders and I end up with a wheelbarrow full of twiggy stems and soggy plant remains. As long as the twiggy bits aren’t too big and woody they will be fine. Vegetable peelings are a good addition and I pop in little boxes and the insides of loo rolls to add a few air pockets.  When you start mowing add the clippings to the heap and give it a stir. A good mixture is best. Don’t add big layers of leaves, they are best put in a bag on their own to make leafmould. Compost works best when the heap has some heat in it; this will kill off any weed seed.  Leafmould works through slowly decomposing, it’s a different process. Use you common sense – if the heap looks too dry, water it or add more green materials. If too wet, add some shredded paper. Turning the heap will help speed the process up a lot. So don’t go to the gym, turn your heap and feel a glowing sense of a job well done!\r\n\r\nSome folk worry about compost heaps attracting rats. We have nine bins here, sited well away from the house  and I can’t say it’s ever been a problem. But here are some tips to keep them away:\r\n\r\n•\tKeep the compost wet, like us, rats prefer to stay dry;\r\n•\tDon’t add fish or meat , dairy products and anything cooked, oily or processed;\r\n•\tKeep pet manure out of the heap.\r\n\r\nFebruary is a good time to prune your wisteria. Once a good framework is established and tied in securely with tree ties, you can prune the smaller side branches down to 2 or three buds. It sounds, and looks ruthless but it works. Pick a mild spell or the pruning plus frost may give it too much of a shock. Give it a spade or two of fresh but cooled bonfire ash or sulphate of potash to encourage flowering and look forward to a lovely show in May.\r\n"},
{"nid":"93","title":"Daffodils in March?","type":"blog","created":"1362096000","body_value":"I can’t write about the March garden without mentioning daffodils; such easy, generous plants. There is a daffodil to suit more or less every taste from the big, bold and blousy to the small and sophisticated. ‘February Gold’ is one of the easiest and most reliable, it  stands about 1.5 feet tall, increases and naturalises well and never fails to flower. ‘February Silver’ is a paler version, comes a little later. Despite their name neither actually flower in February here but no doubt they do further south. ‘Tete a tete’ is a small, dainty daffodil, perfect for a pot or a rockery. It lasts for ages and multiplies well, so if you buy a little pot of it from the garden centre for your windowsill, plant it out afterwards and it will appear every spring for you.  ‘Thalia’ is a beautiful  and elegant white daffodil, at its best in April. We have it growing under weeping pear trees with bluebells.  Another elegant variety is ‘Hawera’, arriving even later. It is really pretty, soft yellow, only about 12” tall and a bit prone to disappear, but it is so lovely it is worth persevering with. \r\nAfter care of daffodils is easy. Deadhead them so they don’t waste their energy setting seed. Don’t cut down the leaves or tie them up, they will be feeding the bulb for next year. Give the leaves a little feed and leave them for at least six weeks or until they go brown.  If they have not produced flowers, they may be congested. Dig them up and replant them good and deep in fresh, well -drained soil; most bulbs like good drainage.\r\nIf you have snowdrops that you would like to make more of you can dig them up now and replant ‘in the green’. Opinions vary as to whether this is the best time to plant them, but it does have the advantage of you being able to see where the gaps are. If you wait until the leaves die down you may be planting them in the wrong place. We have big groups of them here planted with the variegated arum lily, a well tried and tested combination.  Both disappear by late spring and other plants then take over  their space such as peonies, ferns and day lilies.\r\nTalking of bulbs it’s not too late to plant summer bulbs such as lilies. I tend to grow them in pots so I can move them to where I want them but they make decent border plants is you can keep the red lily beetle off them. Keep an eye out for them – the little critters will soon be munching away your prize lilies and the best control is to get to them good and early and dispatch them under your boot!\r\nNow is a good time to tidy your borders. Time spent in March and April digging up weeds and giving the soil a good mulch can pay real dividends, saving you time and energy later in the year. It’s much more satisfying than going to the gym! Summer  flowering clematis can be cut back to a fat bud and given a good feed in March. If you don’t prune them now, all the flowers will tend to be way above your head where you can’t see them! More detailed pruning information for different varieties of clematis can be found on the RHS website.\r\n"},
{"nid":"94","title":"Planting a 'native' hedge","type":"blog","created":"1364770800","body_value":"In an effort to keep our new large dog in the garden we’ve had to have some new fences built. It does make some of the garden feel different, so I’ve been thinking of ways to use the new structures to good effect. One idea I’m toying with is to plant a native hedge next to the fence. When I say native, I really mean natural looking – I’m not about to plant a scruffy, boring row of shrubs. My hedgerow would also have to have some really pretty climbing plants.\r\n\r\nSo what to choose? I love holly, and it would give some winter interest as well as berries for the birds. We have beech elsewhere in the garden so that would look good and fit in. Hawthorn is one of my favourite trees and comes with white, pink or red flowers; it grows quickly too so would tick that box. A shrub rose or two would be lovely and provide some fragrance as would some honeysuckle. A few hazelnut cuttings added in and I think I have a plan. When it’s established, It could all be cut at the same time to keep it in check.\r\n\r\nOr how about a rosemary hedge? I saw one out and about recently, it was lovely: it had been kept well trimmed and was thick and a healthy grey\/green. But unfortunately it wouldn’t like our heavy clay soil, so perhaps not. Worth a try in a sunny, well drained spot though?\r\n\r\nI’ll get small, bare root plants, give them a good soak, prepare the soil really well with some garden compost and keep them well watered and mulched. I’ll need to protect the stems or they will be expensive rabbit food.  All I’ve got to do now is get on with it!\r\n\r\nNow is the time to weed and tidy – do it now and you will reap the benefit all summer.  Don’t be afraid to thin out your self seeders such as poppies and forget me not. If you give them some space they will grow much better and will be less likely to end up straggly or covered in mildew. Watch out for the red lily beetle and the Virburnum beetle:  they come out in force in April and are best caught early before the little blighters do their worst. \r\n\r\nDon’t be tempted to buy tender bedding plants until you are ready. I’m convinced garden centres put them out for sale early to give us time to kill off the first lot and have to buy another load – yes, you can call me cynical! Or buy a packet of seed – much cheaper and more fun. Some seed companies also do little plug plants – a kind of half-way house between sowing seed and buying plants ready to go in the garden. They are often cheap and good quality, I often get tobacco plants like this. All you have to do is put them into a larger pot, and give them some warmth until ready to plant out, usually in June. \r\n\r\nTalking of June we are opening on this year on the afternoons of Sunday 23rd and 30th June for a change. So please put the dates in your diary and come and see us!\r\n\r\nPhotos l to r - variegated holly and Gibbs our 4 legged escape artist.\r\n"},

One thing is for sure, I will be panicking about something! I guess in many ways it may seem a bit odd to invite everyone into your private space, but in my experience it is always worthwhile. To share your precious plants with like -minded folk is a real pleasure; the  community of gardeners  is unfailingly both appreciative and generous spirited. If you don’t believe me go to a Tollerton Garden Club, such lovely folk..\r\n\r\nWe opened through the National Garden Scheme (NGS) for the first time in 2010. If you have seen the programmes with Carol Klein where a formidable (usually female)  garden organiser turns up to pass unsmiling judgement on your garden, that is nowhere near the beginning of our journey into the yellow book.  It was made very easy for us by a kind woman who made some very generous observations about our garden and asked us to change absolutely nothing.  The NGS team have been supportive and kind to us ever since. \r\n\r\nThe NGS has been opening gardens for charity since 1927 and this year nearly 4,000 gardens will be open through the scheme. Charities supported include MacMillan and Marie Curie, £22 million has been donated to charity in the last 10 years. Because of my connection with South Wolds Academy I am allowed to give a proportion of funds raised to Friends of South Wolds, it is they who provide wonderful teas.  I will also have a plant stall, weather and rabbits permitting!\r\n\r\nOther gardens open locally through the NGS in June include  Baxter Farm at Willoughby on 9 June, Bingham Gardens on 16 June and  Riseholme in Shelford on the evening of 19 June. Copies of the yellow book are on sale in all decent bookshops, or you can go online to www.ngs.org.uk or email me if you would like more details.\r\n\r\nSo back to the mowing, watering (if dry), staking (if windy), weeding, slug and lily beetle patrols  and general nurturing.

{"nid":"98","title":"Keep your borders colourful through the summer","type":"blog","created":"1374433463","body_value":"Have any of you bought any multi- purpose compost lately? Are you detecting a change? I’ve got some from 3 different sources over the last few months (Wilkos, Moores and B & Q) and it has all been different from last year’s, not so free draining.  It is also an odd texture – feeling as if it’s been shredded and shoved straight in a bag rather than properly composted.  It will be interesting to see how our plants fare in it – let me know how yours get on. So far I’m not overly impressed and have been adding a lot of grit to it to get the texture right for the plants to thrive.\r\n\r\nHow is your garden looking? What have you got in flower? Late summer can be a challenge unless you plan ahead a bit. Depending on the weather you can also get fed up with constant watering. Even if it rains a fair bit your pots and hanging baskets will need a water as the rain tends to bounce off densely planted pots. Don’t forget to give them a feed as well: they will soon run out of nutrients especially if, like me, you plant closely.  To keep plants flowering and fruiting tomato feed is good.\r\n\r\nI ordered some plug plants again this year including snapdragons and tobacco plants. Both have started out well, I potted them on when they arrived in April and planted out in June.  As long as I can keep our four legged pal and the rabbits off them they should flower until the frosts so are good value for money. They will need the dead flowers picking off and a little, regular feed to keep them going, but it’s worth it. Rather than planting out bedding plants in rows in a separate part of the garden, I use them in little drifts to fill gaps under spring flowering shrubs and among perennials. They look more natural and will sometimes self-seed, adding to the cottagey effect. This year I found some Cleome in a small nursery in Leicestershire.  It’s a tall-ish plant with fragrant leaves with pink, white or purple flowers. The flower is spidery and really pretty, it mixes well with most other plants and adds a bit of height and shape.\r\n\r\nOne of my favourite herbs is lemon verbena. I’ve got one in a pot in a sunny spot and it has grown quite big. It is rather tender so is a bit iffy planted outside here, but down south it more reliably comes through the winter.  I pop it in the greenhouse when frosts threaten and cut it right back around April to keep it fresh and green. It makes the best tea ever, a gorgeous, fragrant lemony taste: you only need a couple of sprigs in a pot.  Mint and fennel tea is my second favourite, great after dinner to help digestion - best in a proportion of 3 sprigs of mint to one of fennel.\r\n\r\nNow is a good time to take cuttings – I’m going to take some from my rather elderly and woody penstemons. Take a non-flowering shoot if you can, around 10cm long, and cut just below a leaf, strip the bottom leaves off and pop several into a pot of free draining compost. Keep them permanently well watered and after a few weeks, you will see little white-ish roots poking out of the bottom of the pot. Put them into separate pots and keep them frost free over winter.  Plant them out next spring and enjoy your lovely new plants for free!\r\n\r\nPhotos left to right: Penstemon, tobacco plants and dayllilies. All taken in July at 'Charnwood'.\r\n"},
{"nid":"99","title":"The very sad loss of our Golden Robinia","type":"blog","created":"1376223680","body_value":"Walking and driving around over this last few weeks I’ve noticed many of you have lost your Golden Robinia trees. After a  little research I discovered the problem, well described by a knowledgeable gardener on the Gardeners World website:\r\n\r\nRobinia pseudoacacia 'Frisia' is currectly suffering from a countrywide disease…. Dry, flakey bark with a canker-like appearance will show it is in fact the virus. There appears to be no cure.\r\n\r\nWe planted ours in 1990 and it has been a lovely feature but it has now definitely popped its clogs. Standing at around 8 metres it’s not going to be much fun to remove, but hey, ho. A dead plant, even a treasured, mature one like this, is a planting opportunity. Just be careful if you decide to do the same, it’s a brittle, spikey tree and could do your bare arms and face serious damage.\r\nThe garden here at Charnwood is moving to what I call its blousy phase. Lots and lots of colour with perennials and annuals stuffed in closely planted borders for maximum impact. I like to feel completely enveloped by the garden so have many tall plants, some in quite small spaces. A favourite in flower now and one much commented on when we opened the garden is Inula Magnifica. A huge plant, it has large bright green leaves and big, fat yellow daisies. Standing about 2 metres high when fully grown it prefers damp-ish soil but apart from that isn’t fussy. Not what you’d call elegant and no good if you like neat plants, but I love it and it is definitely hard to ignore. Another plant admired by garden visitors here is the tobacco plant. I put several in a large pot in a sheltered place and the colour and perfume are both lovely, especially in the evening when the scent fills the whole back garden. I bought plug plants from T and M and can’t fault them. Tobacco plants and other annuals are also good fillers where there were gaps from early flowering shrubs and perennials.\r\nIt’s been a good year for roses. One variety new to us at Charnwood is R. ‘Biddulph Grange’, bought on a visit there a couple of years ago. The single flowers are clear red and in clusters with yellow centres. It seems to be pretty disease free and repeat flowering. It looks lovely right now next to the rich purple\/blue lavender ‘Hidcote’.\r\nMany thanks to everyone who helped on the day and visited ‘Charnwood’ when we opened in June. Over the month we had over 250 visitors and raised £1000 for several national charities and including sizeable cheque to South Wolds Academy. A special thanks to the talented music students from South Wolds who played and sang so beautifully during the 2 Sunday NGS openings; garden visitors loved it and so did we. We gave a small donation from the proceeds straight to the students music council in appreciation.\r\n"},

{"nid":"101","title":"September is a busy month for gardeners!","type":"blog","created":"1377990000","body_value":"This is a good time to take some cuttings of your favourite tender perennials. It really is very easy and you get lots more plants, more or less for free.  Because they are new they are often more vigorous and free flowering than their older ‘parents’. Geraniums, salvias and penstemons can all grow well from tip cuttings. As long as you are prepared to keep them watered and frost free over the winter there is little else to worry about.\r\n\r\nUsing secateurs or a clean, sharp knife, cut off a shoot just below a leaf about 10cm (4”), preferably a non- flowering one but that’s not critical. If there is a flower, cut it off. Trim off some of the bottom leaves and immediately put into some decent, free draining compost. You can buy small bags of seed and cutting compost and it’s worth it: you will get better results. You can dip the base into hormone rooting powder first if you like, but it’s not absolutely necessary. Put the cuttings in quite deep round the edge of a pot. You should be able to get at least 5 round a 6” diameter  pot. Water well and keep damp – you can pop a plastic bag over it but I prefer to keep an eye on them and it’s easier if you don’t. Early next year, when you can see roots coming through the bottom on the pot, tease them out gently and pop  into a bigger pot, let them grow on a bit and then plant them out early summer. Geraniums prefer to be kept a bit drier or they will rot.\r\n\r\nSome other jobs for September – it’s a busy month for gardeners:\r\n\r\n•\tKeep picking your vegetables or your courgettes will turn into marrows\r\n•\tGet your strawberry plants in asap\r\n•\tPrune late flowering shrubs\r\n•\tLift, divide and replant tired looking perennials while the soil is warm, plant the new clumps in some decent soil and throw away the woody growth in the middle of the clump\r\n•\tIf you like a pristine lawn, scarify to get the moss out\r\n•\tGet a compost bin going so you have some of the lovely stuff next year. Turn the ones you have started to speed up the process\r\n•\tPut a net over the pond to prevent leaves falling in\r\n•\tKeep an eye on black spot on roses, remove any affected leaves and burn them or it will pass on to next year’s new growth\r\n•\tKeep deadheading your dahlias and other flowering plants, they will then keep going until the frosts.\r\n\r\nDaffodils were appearing in garden centres last month and now is  a good time to get them in. My favourites are the dainty little ‘Hawera’, the reliable and long lasting ‘February Gold’ and the gorgeous white ‘Thalia’ (pictured). Plant them in generous drifts rather than in rows for best impact. Tulips should wait at least until next month but get those daffs in now and you will enjoy the sunny flowers for many springs to some.\r\n"},
{"nid":"102","title":"Take time to chose a tree","type":"blog","created":"1382295083","body_value":"We inherited some beautiful  mature trees when we moved to ‘Charnwood’. To make sure we continue to enjoy them and pass them on to the next owner in good shape, we occasionally ask a tree specialist to help us to look after them. It’s always money well spent: to see an expert lift and thin the crown of a big old tree is like watching a sculptor make a work of art and the result is at least as good. No cruelly shorn lollipop style trees are allowed here!\r\n\r\nIt was reassuring to hear, too, that our Ash trees have not succumbed to the latest nasty disease, or that our sadly deceased Robinia I wrote about a couple of months ago was not ravaged by honey fungus. Buying in this kind of work is an expense though, so if you are planning to plant a tree it is worth taking the time and effort to think hard about what it is you want from it as some take more keeping in shape than others. It sounds obvious but, if you have a small garden or a small space to fill, don’t plant a big tree and then chop random lumps off it; it almost always looks horrid. There are some lovely small trees that put up with all kinds of weather and need minimal maintenance. Medlar has simple, striking white flowers in spring and grows gently to a short, fairly spreading shape.  Euomymus Alata is a tree-like shrub with brilliant, bright red autumn colour. I’ve eulogised several times in this column about the gorgeous dwarf Japanese cherry, Prunus incicsa Kojo-no-mai (pictured) and am doing so again. It has beautiful almond pink blossom on bare, delicate twiggy branches in March and lovely autumn leaf shades. After 15 years or so, ours in now about 3 metres tall. If you have the right soil and a reasonably sheltered spot an Acer is always worth consideration. Some stay quite compact but check before you buy how tall it will get, garden centres can sometimes be a bit unspecific with eventual tree heights.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, and with the help of our aforementioned tree experts, we started a stumpery in a dark corner of the garden where nothing much grew because of the heavy tree canopy. After a dubious start it’s coming on. Our kind and creative pals Alan and Lauraine built us a magnificent jungle hut that has complemented it very well and I planted some woodland plants and hoped for the best. These include the easy ferns, hardy cyclamen, corydalis, bamboo, periwinkle and spring bulbs such as daffodils and bluebells and they are all doing pretty well. We get some amazing looking fungus appearing,which all adds to the woodland effect and every time we cut a tree down there are a few more lumps of wood to add in. It’s been great fun and it’s a really peaceful spot to sit in and think great thoughts. Or, in Pooh Bear’s words ‘sometimes I sits and think and sometimes I just sits’.\r\n\r\nPlant tulips now. No excuses, you will thank me next spring. Soak the bulbs in cheap tonic water with quinine in before you plant them and the squirrels won’t eat them. Well, they may have a go but they won’t all disappear overnight! I’ve got two big half barrels of yellow wallflowers; I’m going to plant white tulips among them for a lovely effect. White triumphator are the best in my opinion, they are tall, elegant and seem to withstand a fair bit of bad weather. Burgundy are also a good ‘un, another graceful, lily flowered variety. When we opened the garden in late April last year loads of visitors commented on them. \r\n\r\nIt’s a lovely autumn evening so I’m now going to sit in the garden with a glass and the paper.

Holly, or Ilex to give it its grown up name, is a lovely shrub.  We should plant more of it by choice rather than ignoring it as a dull, prickly bush.  It can brighten up a dull corner under trees on or the dark side of the house, you can prune it (carefully, with gloves!), cut lovely branches now to decorate the house and let it get on with growing with little or no work from you. Birds like the berries too and we get little seedlings dotted around the garden here that presumably come from beak or feathery bum. If I spot them before Peter gets out with the strimmer,  I pot them up, grow them on a bit so they can stand the wear and tear of living in our garden, and then plant them along the back of the garden, they are not very fussy about soil. A couple have now made decent sized plants, admittedly after several years.\r\n \r\nYou are spoilt for choice for varieties – they come variegated, with red or yellow berries, some reasonably fast growing, other slow and compact. There is a column shaped one called ‘aquifolium’ ‘Pyramidalis’ and ‘Madam Briot is a hefty variety that makes a good hedge. If you want to make sure of berries you either need to plant a male and female variety within spitting distance, or chose a self fertile one such as ‘J.C.  van Tol’. If you are confused, go to a decent plant nursery as now is a good time to plant as long as you pick a mild spell. Rather surprisingly the rabbits ate one I planted last year:; I would have thought it was a rather uncomfortable meal. So be warned!\r\n\r\nIvy is undersung as well (apart from in carols at Christmas) and can make a lovely feature. I’ve got ‘Sulphur Heart’ growing up the garage.

It makes good ground cover as long as you don’t let it travel  everywhere and smother your treasured plants.\r\n\r\nMany hundreds of years ago in some villages  there was a midwinter custom of holding singing contests between men and women, where the men sang carols praising holly for its masculine qualities while women sang songs praising the ivy for its womanliness, and disparaging holly. It was often resolved under the mistletoe!.  Ideas as to what is was about them  both that had a distinct and different gender bias on a postcard please!\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a Christmas present for a keen gardener or flower arranger, my son bought me the most beautiful pair of pruning scissors from Ernest Wright. They are a perfect weight, sit comfortably in the hand and cut cleanly. They are a truly lovely thing.\r\n\r\nHappy holiday and all the best for 2014. \r\n"},
{"nid":"106","title":"How to love your garden in February","type":"blog","created":"1391212800","body_value":"It’s hard to love your garden in February, isn’t it unless you are blessed with lots of early Spring bulbs? Earliest here are snowdrops and winter aconites. The latter are especially cherished as they are a cheery bright yellow and it took me ages to get them established on our heavy soil.  I love crocus, but they tend to be mouse food here, or fatally pecked over by birds. I get round it a bit by planting some in pots and keeping them covered, but it’s hard to get a good annual show by that method without a lot of work and expense.\r\n\r\nFebruary Gold is one of my favourite daffodils, but it usually flowers in March so it’s not well named, not this far north at any rate. We’ve a lovely swathe of them on our back lawn mixed in with clumps of the slightly later flowering  and paler February Silver. If you buy little pots of bulbs from the garden centre to brighten up your house or porch, remember you can plant them out after they have flowered so you can enjoy them for years to come. \r\n\r\nIf you do want to get out there on a sunny day, here are some jobs you can be getting on with:\r\n\r\n•\tIn a mild spell prune your Buddleia to about one third of its summer height. You can be quite ruthless and, if you go for it, you will prevent it from becoming huge and ugly looking. The same applies to Mahonia – prune out some old stems each year to the ground and you will keep it rejuvenated. Wisteria can also be hard pruned now – if you have an established framework of branches cut back to 2 or 3 buds on all the lateral stems and it will flower better for you, especially if you give it a handful of sulphate of potash or a spadeful of wood ash. The RHS website is really good for more detailed instructions with useful diagrams;\r\n•\tCheck out your greenhouse if you have one for signs of pest and mould. Dahlias in particular can go rotten quickly, so it’s worth a check every now and then.  \r\n•\tYou can start sowing seeds,  which always cheers me up on a dark late winter’s day. If you can provide some heat in a greenhouse or a well lit windowsill, sow a few tomatoes. I admit it’s a bit early and I quite often don’t get round to it until early April, but you may be picking your first tomatoes in later June if you look after them and keep your fingers crossed!\r\nWith Valentine’s Day approaching I wonder if any of you are lucky enough to have mistletoe growing on one of your trees? I’ve had several goes at getting it going to no avail. Mistletoe is the only truly aerial parasitic plant that can be found in Britain and has evolved to rely on birds to help spread its seeds. The word mistletoe even originates from the Anglo-Saxon \"mistel-tan\" meaning dung on a stick – delightful! While the berries of mistletoe are poisonous to us humans, they are loved by birds –especially the mistle thrush and over-wintering blackcaps. Inside each of the white berries is a single green seed, surrounded by a sticky pulp. Once eaten, the seeds are pooed onto another host tree when the bird is perching – the sticky pulp helping to secure it in place. Seeds are also spread by birds wiping the pulp from their beaks.\r\nHappy Valentine’s Day!\r\n"},
{"nid":"107","title":"Interesting Spring flowering shrubs","type":"blog","created":"1393632000","body_value":"Shrubs are often seen as the rather boring mainstay of the garden and can look quite uninspiring for much of the year. But in Spring and early summer they really come into their own and can be real stars both in flower and scent. If you plant them in a mixed border you can situate other plants around them that will provide interest at other seasons; most shrubs combine really well with bulbs and perennials. One more unusual planting suggestion: I have a viticella clematis next to a Cotinus so it can scramble over it and provide a bit more interest. I prune the clematis hard in late winter.\r\n\r\nOne of the most effective early spring combinations I’ve seen is the red multi stemmed dogwoods underplanted with daffodils. Really striking, and after the daffodils have finished the dogwoods will come into leaf and hide their dying foliage. In fact spring bulbs under just about any shrub will bring bare soil to life when you most need a lift. Prune one third of the dogwood back to the ground each year to keep the stems brightly coloured and the plant lively.\r\n\r\nExochordia x macrantha ‘The Bride’ (pictured) is a gorgeous white frothy meringue of a shrub that is really easy to grow and prune. You can even grow it as a standard but I prefer to keep it smallish and rejuvenated by cutting back all the stems that have flowered when finished, say June time. Most spring flowering shrubs can be treated this way, please don’t prune them into a lollipop! We have an unknown variety of Weigela from a cutting donated by a long deceased parent that reminds me of him every time it comes into flower in late spring. Every other year I prune it hard back, trying to keep its natural, graceful shape while giving it a chance to stay young and floriferous. A good feed and mulch after pruning, plus a good soak if it’s dry will bring best results for all shrubs. \r\n\r\nI admit to not being a great fan of most Ceanothus. The blue looks somehow artificial to me, making it hard to place.  However if you do have one don’t prune it hard unless forced, they don’t like it much and are likely to pop their clogs. Magnolia similarly can protest if you set to with the pruners, but why would anyone would want to prune a gorgeous magnolia? Just do your research before you buy and get one that suits your allotted space, bearing in mind that Magnolias prefer slightly acid soil. The same applies to Camellias; they are woodland plants preferring acid, fairly moist conditions. Keep them well watered, especially in late summer when next year’s buds are forming, otherwise they may drop off.\r\n\r\nThe Viburnum family is a mixed bunch, some more glorious and interesting than others. One of my favourites, especially for the delicious scent, is V. Juddii. It is deciduous but that’s no sad loss: viburnum leaves are fairly boring. But in April pretty pink buds appear and open out to almost white and the whole garden fills with a gorgeous perfume. If you have an evergreen viburnum, watch out from now for the viburnum beetle that will munch your plant and leave it all brown and crinkly. You can prevent it to some extent with the right spray. I prefer to prune out affected branches, which keeps it at bay. I don’t think total eradication is likely but if you have managed it, please let me know how!\r\n\r\nDon’t forget to deadhead your daffodils, give them a handful of plant food and don’t tie them up into bundles. That way they are more likely to flower well for you next year. If they have stopped flowering it may mean they are a bit tired and malnourished.  Dig them up and replant them spaced out a bit with a little fresh compost and good and deep. They may take a year to settle down but then you should have your hard work rewarded by a lovely show in Spring 2016.\r\n"},
{"nid":"108","title":"Messy gardens rule","type":"blog","created":"1398861345","body_value":"It’s the middle of March as I write this and I have just had a smashing day pottering in my very messy garden. Why messy I hear you say?  I’ve been so busy lately I haven’t had chance to spend time in it, and, on the odd occasion when I have, the weather has been awful. Fortunately I’m not an obsessively neat gardener, quite the contrary. So now I have got around to it, I have found some lovely little surprises under all the dead and manky stuff. A few self seeded crocus, honesty seedlings (most weeded out); violets in abundance, both white and purple and some lovely hellebores whose old leaves I have now cut off so I can see them at their best. The endless wet weather doesn’t seem to have harmed anything in the garden as far as I can tell so far and the spring bulbs have been fabulous. You can lift and divide snowdrops clumps now they have finished flowering. Opinions vary as to whether its best to do it ‘in the green’ or when dormant. But if you do it now you can at least see what you are doing and where the gaps are. Plant them good and deep and in generous drifts.\r\n\r\nSelf seeders can be a real asset in the border as long as you don’t let them take over, they can fill in early gaps and hold your planting together. Forget me nots are an obvious choice and are also a culprit for colonising; sow a packet and within a couple of years you will have thousands. If you thin them out well, they will grow better and are less likely to succumb to that horrid grey mould as the air can circulate better around them. Poppies are another love of mine, I mean the annual ones that are cheap to buy and easy to grow. There is a big choice from the little Californian poppies that usually come in reds and yellows to the huge, voluptuous opium poppy that reminds me of a party frock and here at Charnwood sows itself around in various shades of purple and pink. I’ve also got some treasured seed from Great Dixter of Poppy somniferum ‘Danish Flag’ that are a striking red with a white cross. I will sow those directly into a sunny spot. I have also sowed some poached egg plant which I love, but so do the rabbits; I hope they don’t notice them before they get going! Seeds to sow for filling gaps later on can include tender plants such as Tithonia, cleome, tobacco plants and cosmos.\r\n\r\nIf you dug up your dahlia tubers last autumn and they are sitting around looking sad and a bit shrivelled, cut out the soggy bits and pop them into an old pot to get them going a bit before you plant them outside. You will give them a head start and get earlier flowers. Don’t be fooled, keep them frost free, they quickly go to mush if it gets chilly. I have a bit of horticultural fleece or an old curtain at the ready to throw over tender plants if a frost is threatened.\r\n\r\nWe are having a year off from opening our garden this year, so I’m hoping to find some time to do some more garden visiting. If you do the same, let me know where you’ve been and I’ll spread the word. If you are planning a new garden or replenishing your old one and want inspiration there is no better place to start than in local gardens where the conditions will be similar to your own. Amateur gardeners are a mine of useful information and they will always be happy to share their successes and failures with you. \r\n\r\nApril is a lovely month in the garden, so full of pretty, early flowers and leaves and much promise. Keep weeding and watching out for those bloomin pests (it’s red lily beetle alert time) and pray for sun in the day and gentle rain at night when we are tucked up in bed. Sweet dreams!\r\n"},
{"nid":"109","title":"The joys of compost making","type":"blog","created":"1398898800","body_value":"Now the mowing season is underway, what are you doing with your grass clippings? How about turning them into compost?  No, it’s not that hard work, and if you always put them in the green bin, shame on you and please read on….\r\n\r\nI confess I am a compost anorak. I bloomin love the stuff. To put a load of garden waste (and other materials – see later) in a pile that turns into beautiful, dark, crumbly compost warms my poor old gardener’s heart. There has been a huge amount of research into how to make it and how it can benefit your soil and it is Absolutely All Good News. There are billions of beneficial organisms in a spoonful of compost (OK, I may exaggerate, but only a bit) that improve the structure of your soil, whether it’s really heavy clay like here at Charnwood, or if it’s dry and sandy, or any in between. And if you get the soil in good heart, your plants will thrive. Without many years of applying garden compost I would not be able to grow the range, quality and quantity of plants we do here, the soil would not let me.  So, how to do it?\r\n\r\nFirst – relax, it’s not rocket science. The trick is to get it not too wet or dry. So you need a mixture of wet and dry, or ‘green’ and ‘brown’ material. Green includes your grass clippings or kitchen waste, brown is items such as last year’s bedding plants or leftover dead perennials, shredded paper or straw. Little pill boxes and the insides of loo rolls are a good addition, they trap some air, which helps. We keep a pedal bin in the kitchen for vegetable and fruit peelings, egg shells and tea bags and add that. Nothing cooked on your compost heap please or you may attract rats, and not big layers of dry leaves; they will slow the process down unless they are chopped up with the mowings.\r\n\r\nNow – add it to the mix and give it a regular stir. We have nine compost bins (hence the anorak status) but I would recommend at least 2 for any but the smallest garden. That way you can fill up one bin and, when it’s got going and is all nice and steamy, you can turn it into the other. Turning it speeds up the composting process hugely. When you turn it, give a good stir.  If it feels a bit soggy, add some more brown matter such as paper shreddings. When it’s too dry, put the hose on it for a bit. Fresh farmyard manure can burn plants, so that is best added to the compost heap. If you do this often enough you will get lovely compost in a matter of weeks. If, like me, you are a bit old and tired and just leave it, it may take months or even a year. But why worry? You can a) cancel your gym membership and\/or get a better night’s sleep and b) feel smug as it’s free and c) feel happy for your plants as it’s fab for your garden.  Finally – I’ve just weeded a border and mulched it lightly with my compost. Comparisons with Kew Gardens very welcome. (Note we are not opening this year!).\r\n"},
{"nid":"110","title":"Roses rule in June","type":"blog","created":"1401794384","body_value":"The June garden speaks to me in roses. I know some are out earlier in the year, but walking through the sight and smell of their gorgeous blooms gladdens my poor old gardeners’ heart right now.\r\n\r\nTalking of earlies, if you passed our front gate late April\/early May you will have seen a single, yellow flowering rose covering our front gate. That is R. ‘Canary Bird’. It is really easy shrub rose so not fussy about pruning, with lovely ferny leaves.  Apart from the odd smattering of flowers later on it tends to only flower once but it is a really good show when it does.  R. Glauca flowers mid spring; good for more natural settings as it is a small, species rose with small pink flowers. We have it as underplanting  in an area shaded by silver birches. It copes well and has big, showy hips later on.\r\n\r\nMy new favourite rose is ‘Biddulph Grange’. Peter and I visited that National Trust property famous for its dahlias a few years ago on our wedding anniversary. It is shrub rose with bright red single flowers with white centres and yellow stamens. A repeat flowerer and  stays really healthy all year, it is  real star all summer and mixes well with other plants unlike some of the more showy hybrid tea roses.\r\n\r\nI’ve written about R. ‘Laura Ford’ (pictured) several times here and it remains a favourite. It is a short climber, to about 3 or 4 metres with small but beautiful double yellow flowers that age a bit pink. The old fashioned tea scent is wonderful and it repeat flowers if, like most roses, you give it a regular feed. I give it a good drink every now and then as well as it’s planted close to a wall where it gets very dry, even when it’s been raining. Roses hate poor, dry soil.\r\n\r\nHaving said that we have R. ‘Mme. Alfred Carriere’ growing out of a small hole in our patio climbing valiantly up the back of the house.  It’s in a fairly grim, windy spot so if you want a rose that will put up with poorer conditions, this is the one. She has beautiful, creamy white double flowers,a Noisette if you care about such things! To be kind I water and feed it a bit, but not reliably, and it doesn’t seem to mind too much if I forget.\r\n\r\nIt used to be the fashion to have roses planted out in a bed to themselves, and you still do sometimes see it. It can look wonderful and the perfume fabulous.  I try and mix them at Charnwood, mainly because I want a succession of flowers. You can plant other things round them that either complement their flowers and bloom at the same time, or come out after so the colour carries on when they are over. A classic planting combination is to underplant your roses with hardy geraniums. Pick a scrambler rather than an upright variety so the rather boring stems are covered up. You can cut the geraniums hard back in the autumn or spring and distribute a good feed and a prune depending on the rose. I have also seen violets, violas and primroses planted in rose gardens for early ground cover, with wigwams of sweet peas or clematis among them to carry on later into the summer. I have good combination of a red climbing rose and a purple clematis, varieties long forgotten I’m afraid. As long as the rose is well established before you inflict a climbing partner on it and you keep them both well fed and watered, you will get a lovely effect. Old trees can be brightened up by a climber or a rambler; rose that is, not the human variety.\r\n\r\nTake some time out to enjoy your garden in this (hopefully) lovely month!\r\n"},
{"nid":"111","title":"The Chelsea chop, getting the hang of astrantias, and fab ferns","type":"blog","created":"1406147196","body_value":"Have you heard of the ‘Chelsea chop’? If not, it’s nothing to do with what you may be having for dinner. It refers to the practice of cutting back your perennials early this month (or bit earlier, hence the nod to Chelsea flower Show at the end of May) to make them shorter so less likely to flop and flower a little later. It works well with plants such as the bigger sedums, phlox and helenium.\r\n\r\nIt does look a bit drastic, so what I do is cut some back and leave the rest. That way you get a longer flowering season. Of course if you have wonderfull y staked, sturdy plants there is no need.\r\n\r\nThe other job to be getting on with is deadheading. Most flowering plants benefit from it, if you let them set seed they can think their job is done and stop flowering. Roses, sweet peas, bedding plants such as geraniums and most of the daisy family all benefit from a regular snip. I cut back hard alchemilla mollis as well, although they are a great plant they can take over.\r\n\r\nI’ve finally got the hang of astrantias. They are lovely this year in the borders at Charnwood obviously thriving after the early wet weather. If you are not familiar with them, the pretty little flowerheads look like little pincushions, lasting for weeks. Astrantias belong to the cow parsley family and prefer moisture retentive soil  in light shade and an occasional mulch of compost. They have a reasonable colour range, mainly pale pinks through to the ones I love, the dark, rich reds. My experience here is that they don’t look much when you first plant them and take 2 or 3 years to clump up and get established, but when they do it’s clear they are worth a bit of patience. It’s the kind of plant that doesn’t take up too much room and mixes well. \r\nAnother plant that has loved the wet weather are ferns. Again they take a while to get going, but we now have a good collection. The shuttlecock fern Matteuccia struthiopteris has been absolutely spectacular, growing to around 5 feet. That one likes damp soil, but some, such as the Dryopteris family (pictuired), can tolerate drier conditions. Ferns prefer to be planted  or divided in the spring with a good mulch of leafmould if you have it.\r\nThis is the time of year I do a bit of cheating. I have a few dahlias in pots ready to pop into gaps in the border. I keep them in the pots so can stick them back in the greenhouse when the frosts do for them. Works well for me and you can try it for other plants such as lilies or fuchsias. Usually there are cosmos to plant around early perennials such as poppies which can be cut back hard to make space. But the rabbits ate them all this year the little critters. I am normally a peace loving vegetarian, but if you have a gun and fancy rabbit pie please give me a ring…\r\n"},
{"nid":"112","title":"Structural plants for drama","type":"blog","created":"1407096567","body_value":"How do you like your flower borders – cottagey, neat, blousy, colour themed, bold as brass? We all have our own preferred style, apart from those of us who just buy a plant, dig a hole and enjoy it. Who is to say which of us is right? In the end it’s your garden so do what you want and have fun. (barring illegal and antisocial stuff I hasten to add).\r\n\r\nSince you asked (well I knew you’d want to) I like mine crammed with plants to the point it looks almost out of control. Bare soil is an absolute ‘no no’. To be honest this year it actually has been out of control, but that’s another story! I keep an eye on colour, but enjoy bold contrasts as well as gentle harmony. But some plants I can’t be without are the large, dramatic ones that provide structure. Don’t think ‘small garden, must have small plants’ either. Some of the best small gardens I’ve seen have a few carefully chosen large specimens. Here are a few of my favourites:\r\n\r\n Scottish Thistle (Onopordum acanthium). Huge feller, is currently standing way over my head and it as the name suggests, is like a giant thistle. Gorgeous bright grey spikey leaves (pictured)  so don’t plant it near where the children play! This is a biannual, which means is sets seed and grows a fairly low rosette of leaves in the first year, then he flowers, seeds around  and dies in the next. \r\n\r\nGunnera – I’ve heard people say this is only for very big gardens and it’s true that when it gets going it’s very large. if you have the space its natural habitat is damp shade so it looks best by water. It has big leaves, reminiscent of a rhubarb. Give it a mulch in winter as it’s rumoured to be not too hardy but it’s been going here now for at least 10 years or so through some pretty harsh winters. I do have a tiny gunnera, only a few centimetres high, but to be honest it’s more a plant for the obsessive gardener and plant snob like me: it doesn’t add a lot to the overall ambiance! \r\n\r\nDarmera peltata (Indian rhubarb) is a much underrated and often misnamed plant. It throws up really pretty pink flowers a bit like a huge saxifrage (to which it’s related) on bare stems in early spring. Big leaves follow for drama not unlike a smaller gunnera,  so a good choice if space is more limited. It likes the same damp situations, so happy in a bog garden.\r\nMacleaya cordata, or Plume poppy is a bit of a thug, but good for a biggish space in fairly natural planting scheme. It can reach 3 metres, has pretty leaves not unlike a huge oak leaf and feathery, astilbe like flowers in a pretty kind of beigey pink. Not fussy here as to soil or situation, but it is a little prone to early frost damage so best with a bit of shelter.\r\n\r\nYucca is a bit of a marmite plant, I sit firmly in the ‘love it’ camp. I know the recent fashion is for    Phormium, but the leaves die and become ugly fairly quick and I find them really hard to place in our natural style country setting. Yuccas however say ‘tropical’ without being hard to keep going and looking good, and do seem to fit better in the borders here. We have the variegated one which is very hardy and is lovely next to red companions such as poppies and roses and is a good host for climbers like the orange Chilean glory vine (pictured). Again though, keep the youngsters away, they have viscous spikes.\r\n"},
{"nid":"113","title":"Winter scent","type":"blog","created":"1412118000","body_value":"Now the days are getting shorter, time in the garden is more precious, especially if you are out at work all day. Sitting among the flowers or under a tree in a favourite spot is a lovely, relaxing way to end the day so it’s worth doing a bit of planning. \r\n\r\nScent is a big consideration. A waft of something nice and smelly in the evening is fabulous with a glass or a cup of something recuperative. It’s easy in the spring and summer when there are roses, honeysuckle and stocks; we are spoilt for choice, but what about the colder months? Here’s a few suggestions:\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Virburnums have gorgeous scents. There is a winter flowering one V. bonantense  with little pink flowers that smell of almonds. In  spring V. judii comes into its own, one of the best perfumes of all in my humble opinion, fills the whole garden. \r\n\r\nDaffodils can be very fragrant, but be careful. Some smell a bit musky to me, like old, damp socks or the dog after he’s jumped in a muddy ditch. But many folk do like the scent; look out for bulbs with ‘jonquil’ in the title. The best early bulb for scent I think are hyacinths. If you get one in a pot you can pop it in the garden after and it will flower year after year. They come smaller but are none the worse for that; white shows up best in the evening.  If you plant up a pot of polyanthus and some bulbs now and put them by your favourite spot outside, you will have something to keep your nose and eyes happy for a long while.\r\n\r\nDaphnes (see picture) can look a bit boring for much of the year, but they are unrivalled for really early scent, it is almost overpowering. Daphne bholua ‘Jacqueline Possett’ is  easy to find in garden centres. Her buds are pink, opening to almost white, but there are other varieties equally lovely.  Daphnes are usually small shrubs, so easy to find space for but they are a little tender so find her a bit of shelter please.\r\n\r\nMahonia is dead easy, will stand shade and neglect and flowers spectacularly in sunny yellow that smell of lily of the valley. Winter flowering and evergreen, it looks  a bit like a holly and makes a big shrub if you don’t prune it and eventually ends up big even if you do. We have one in a woodland setting here at Charnwood, it looks perfect. \r\n\r\nSeating and lighting also need to be planned for. Lighting can be expensive, but you can always pop a night light in a jam jar. Space for a seat in a spot that picks up the evening sun is best, and that’s not necessarily where you might want it in the summer when you might roast. \r\n\r\nIf, like me, you work hard to keep your garden looking good, it’s worth extending the time you can enjoy it. We’ve been known to have a barbeque with our coats on in November, such is our love of being in the garden all year round! \r\n"},
{"nid":"114","title":"Putting the garden to bed for winter","type":"blog","created":"1417264297","body_value":"If you’re a bit of a dreamer like me the mild weather may have lulled you into a false sense of security – or more accurately a false sense that the garden will stay looking like it’s late summer for the next 6 months! Clearly, and as certain as death and taxes, winter will come,  so it’s worth getting ready for it. As much as anything else a bit of planning and toil now will not only get your garden looking tidier, but it can also make sure you have a good show next year.\r\n\r\nHaving said ‘tidier’ one bit advice I’d give is don’t be too tidy! It’s a well -rehearsed mantra that wildlife likes a few weeds, leaves and general messiness to eat and live in.  Apart from that if you are too assiduous with your weeding and mulching you may be digging up or smothering seedlings that can make your borders look really pretty and naturalistic next year. Seedlings of forget me nots, foxgloves, poppies and  verbena to mention just a few will be getting going right now and are worth leaving to develop over winter. If there are a lot growing together  in a clump, weed out most of them to leave  few inches around each new plant to let it grow well without too much competition.\r\n\r\nTender plants such as dahlias, cannas, agaves, eucomis  and some cordylines need bringing in to a frost free place. Having said that, I have clumps of dahlias and eucomis planted in a fairly sheltered spot I leave in the ground – a decent mulch of grit or compost usually protects them. They come a bit later than the ones I protect in the greenhouse, but I don’t mind that. If your cordylines or other tender leafy plants are too big to bring in or you are feeling brave, you can pop some straw into their centres and tie them up with string, it will protect them to some extent but doesn’t look pretty. \r\n\r\nNow is a good time to plant up some pots for the spring. Tulips can be planted right up to December and be fine in my experience. If you soak them in tonic water with quinine in it for a couple of hours before you plant them it usually prevents the squirrels from noshing them, the little critters. I swear they go to the garden centre and find out which are the most expensive ones to make sure they eat all those first! If you pop a few plants of spring bedding – violas and primroses are my favourite –  on top you will have a pot to keep you happy for a long while. \r\n\r\nRoses can now be bought bare rooted and ready to plant. You don’t have the advantage of seeing them in flower, but if you know what you want it’s far cheaper and they settle in better this time of year. Prepare the ground well, roses like rich, nutritious soil so will thrive in our heavy clay. Fruit trees can also be purchased in this way.\r\n\r\nNext time I’ll be making suggestions for Christmas presents again. Where on earth does the time go….\r\n"},
{"nid":"115","title":"Looking good in December","type":"blog","created":"1419771074","body_value":"Our little woodland area is looking lovely at the moment with many small clumps of hardy cyclamen sprinkled around in pink and white. There are precious few flowers around at this time of year so they are a very welcome sight.\r\n\r\nThere are two different kinds of hardy cyclamen common in our gardens. The one out now is usually C. hederifolium (pictured)– literally ‘with leaves like ivy’.  Later on the pretty pink and white flowers of C. Coum arrive, so you can have cyclamen in flower from autumn through to early spring. Their favourite spot is in shade underneath trees and shrubs where there is little else growing and they can gently spread around undisturbed. If you get a little one in a pot it is often worth putting in in the ground once it’s finished flowering – but don’t do this with their bigger, more tender relatives, they will curl up their toes and die.  Don’t plant too deeply and dig in a little leaf mould or compost if you have it and they will look after themselves and bring you pleasure at this time of year for many seasons to come.\r\n\r\nAlso looking good here at Charnwood is our Mahonia ( pictured). An unprepossessing, easy evergreen shrub also liking woodland conditions, it is coming into flower now with its gorgeous yellow scented spikes in profusion. If you have a shady corner where nothing much will grow, give it a go. It’s a fairly big plant and a bit prickly not unlike a holly so take that into account if you are planting it by a path.\r\n\r\nChristmas is nearly upon us if you hadn’t noticed! We are just back from a lovely trip to Amsterdam and had a morning perusing the bookshops. The talented and inspirational Dutch garden designer Piet Oudolf has written a number of books, many promoting his ‘prairie’ style of planting. I have his ‘Designing with Plants’ but they all seem very good and useful if you like the more naturalistic approach to garden design using perennials and grasses. We also had a look around the tulip museum and I leafed through Anna Pavord’s ‘The Tulip’ – another lovely book with some gorgeous photos. The history of the Tulip is fascinating even if you are not an avid gardener and\/or bulb lover.  I have her minimally titled and beautifully illustrated ‘Bulb’, which is also a good read.\r\n\r\nA present I have given to several friends is a pretty tin with some packets of seed inside, carrots and beetroot for the vegetable gardener and sweet peas and calendula for flower lovers. A decent set of secateurs is always welcome and you can never have enough decent string. I know what you are thinking,  string doesn’t leap straight into your thoughts when planning gift purchases, but I love the stuff and even keep a ball in the shed for sniffing – strange but harmless?\r\n\r\nLast time I suggested you set aside somewhere good to sit outside to enjoy your garden in winter so how about a few night light holders for your loved one to light up your dark evenings? Plant a few hardy cyclamen close by or a fragrant mahonia, get yourselves a hot chocolate and relax!\r\n\r\nI’ll be back in February so stay safe and warm until then and all the best for 2015.\r\n"},
{"nid":"116","title":"Get your garden ready for the new season now!","type":"blog","created":"1424199299","body_value":"I hope you gardeners have some good, strong gloves, a warm coat, sharp secateurs and a compost bin empty and ready to be filled. Between now and April is the time to get out there and get ready for the rest of the year; time spent now is always worthwhile and saves more work later on. Here are a few jobs to get you going:\r\n\r\n•\tWisteria should be hard pruned now. If you have an already established framework of stems, make sure they are well tied in and cut back each branch to 2 or 3 buds (see photo). It sounds drastic, but you will be rewarded with more flowers. Do it in a mild spell and give it a good water and a handful of bonfire ash or sulphate of potash to get those flowers moving;\r\n•\tYou can also hard prune shrubs such as cotinus (smoke bush), and sambucus if you prefer a lower growing, multi stemmed effect with bigger leaves. You are unlikely to get any flowers but you will get real impact;\r\n•\tCut back your deciduous ornamental grasses to the ground. If they are evergreen – such as the golden oat (stipa gigantea) put on a pair of stout rubber gloves and pull out the dead leaves;\r\n•\tTalking of grasses, now is the time to lift and divide them, they hate it at other times of the year. Again, pick a gentle weather week and do it when you can see new growth. You can be quite brutal and cut it up with a spade as long as there is plenty of root on each piece; prepare the soil well and keep them watered for a few weeks after;\r\n•\tCut back old stems of perennials as you have time and energy. No need to be too tidy or do it too early, they are little havens for wildlife such as ladybirds who you will find having a snooze there in winter. Chop up the stems and add to the compost heap. They work well with grass clippings, soaking up some of the sogginess and getting some air into the heap;\r\n•\tEarly March is a good time to prune clematis. It’s not as complicated as you think, if in doubt just prune hard back to a strong shoot and give the plant a handful of feed, a thick mulch and a good drink. They like a moist, humus rich shady root run with the flowers in the sun. For a more detailed description of how to prune the different types the RHS website is good;\r\n•\tCheck overwintering dahlias and cannas regularly for signs of rotting and mildew;\r\n•\tWhen your snowdrops have finished flowering you can lift and divide them to make a bigger show next year; \r\n•\tPrune autumn fruiting raspberries to ground level;\r\n•\tWeed and mulch your borders while there is still bare soil and you can see where things are. It’s easy to bury the smaller, special plants, I’ve done it times!\r\n\r\nI could go on, but you get the idea, it’s a busy time for us in the garden for the next few months! If you haven’t already you can get on with sowing vegetable seeds under cover. It’s plenty early enough in my view. If you sow too soon they only end up leggy and ready to plant out before the ground is ready. I’ve planted tomatoes as late as April before now and still got a decent crop. My advice is if you want to try something out don’t let the experts put you off with complicated instructions, use your common sense and have a go  – it’s your garden, what have you got to lose?!\r\n\r\n"},
{"nid":"117","title":"Allotments, compost and a flowering cherry","type":"blog","created":"1427654929","body_value":"I’ve a friend who is really excited as she is about to take custody of an allotment. You will know if you read this column regularly that  I’m no Monty Don when it comes to vegetable gardening, but when she asked for advice I suggested two things I could not be without in any garden:  compost bins and fruit. We share our garden with too many rabbits to grow many leafy crops!\r\n\r\nFruit first – we’ve got raspberries and redcurrants at Charnwood as well as apples, pears, gages and plums. We even have a Medlar – a good tree for a small garden with pretty white flowers and weird but fascinating fruits that look like they come from another planet – but I digress. The fruit trees I admit I get an expert to look after for us, we’ve a lot and fortunately can afford it as it’s worth it to keep them in good shape. If you are buying fruit trees – you can plant them now – check out the root stock so you know how big it will end up.  You may also need more than one to make sure pollination occurs; unless the tree you choose is self- fertile, or you have a neighbour with a similar tree,  you won’t get any fruit.\r\n\r\nSoft fruit plants are cheap and easy to get going and you can plant now. My Dad used to have a posh, huge  fruit cage and used to joke he grew the most expensive soft fruit in the world. I just plant plenty and hope the birds don’t steal them all! To be honest I don’t always get round to pruning the currants but they still bear shedloads of gorgeous shiny red fruit. However if you want good pruning instructions with useful diagrams, the RHS website is good. Raspberries are really easy: again you can plant them now into well manured ground – they like some sun but will tolerate a little shade. Plant  them 18” apart  and prune them down to about a foot. You need to check out whether your canes are summer or autumn fruiting as you will prune them at different times. All fruit likes potash or a spadeful or two of fresh bonfire ash. But don’t worry if this sounds like too much trouble. Most fruit will do its thing despite us! \r\n\r\nOur garden here wouldn’t be what it is without compost. When we came here in 1987 the soil was thick heavy clay and still is in places. We have bought in mushroom compost and farmyard manure when we have had time, energy and money to spare, but your own garden compost is free and is marvellous stuff. It’s not rocket science to make either, as long as you have a reasonable mix of green material such as grass clippings, and brown materials such as paper or woodier stuff, and you give it a good mix occasionally, all will be fine. Don’t put in pernicious perennial weeds such as couch grass or dock leaves.  The best arrangement is to have three bins. Fill up the two outside ones and when they have composted down by half, turn them into the middle one to finish off. Give it a water if it’s a bit dry and add some more grass clippings if it needs heating up a bit. By this time next year at the latest you will have lovely, dark compost full of beneficial organisms and nutrients. \r\n\r\nI’m looking forward to my dwarf Japanese Cherry flowering  later this month (pictured). It’s another excellent tree for a small garden, ours here is now around 25 years old and 10 feet high. Its grown up name is Prunus incisa ‘Kojo-no-mai’, easily available from garden centres. The flowers arrive on bare stems, starting out as deep pink buds opening to a beautiful soft pink. The leaves have good, bright autumn colour and in winter the branches are fine and delicate. \r\n"},
{"nid":"118","title":"Primroses and violets","type":"blog","created":"1428845639","body_value":"Easter means primroses, cowslips and violets to me. Daffodils too, but I have written many times about those fab bulbs, so it’s the first two lovelies I am going to wax lyrical about this time.\r\n\r\nThe name ‘Primula veris’, the cowslip, appeared in literature as a remedy as far back as 1101. Leonardo da Vinci was supposed to have found their leaves tasty – I don’t recommend you try that at home! The common primrose Primula vulgaris has also been around for centuries, and the two often cross pollinate to make what is commonly called the false oxlip, P. variabilis. It’s is a big family, also producing polyanthus which flood our garden centres in March and April with a massive range of bright colours. Polyanthis means ‘many flowers’ and you will see if you look closely they have several flowers at the end of one stem, unlike the primrose.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, other colours have been cropping up for a long while, with red primroses being referred to around 1600. I have some orangey red cowslips in my garden which I tolerate despite my love of the yellow ones! Double primroses are also not an invention of modern breeders, for example the lovely P.lilicina plena ‘Quakers Bonnett’ dates back to the eighteenth century. I find the double ones a bit fussier and harder to grow, but if you find the right spot they are charming.\r\n\r\nWhen you are planting primroses, have a think about how they grow in the wild. They thrive at the edge of woodland, not in deep shade, and you will also see them on embankments where they will seed themselves down the slopes on the motorway and by the railways. They do not like hot, dry sunny places and are fine under deciduous shrubs and trees where there is a little sun in spring before the leaf cover gets thicker and it stays fairly damp. \r\n\r\nViolets are a perfect companion plant to primroses, enjoying similar growing conditions. They too are steeped in folklore, the Ancient Greeks loved them for both their prettiness and for medicinal use. They aren’t wildly showy, and you have to get down on your knees to sniff their gorgeous fragrance but it’s worth it even if your knees are old and creaky like mine!  Violets spread quite quickly using runners (bit like strawberries) and can be propagated very easily. Like the primrose there are many old and new cultivars, mainly in the white\/pink\/violet range.  ‘Diana Groves’ is a new violet grown by Groves Nurseries www.grovesnurseries.co.uk with wine red petals. ‘Lianne’ is deep purple with a strong perfume, raised in France at the turn of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nSo how about this – find yourself a spot with decent soil in gentle shade, not too dry. Dig in some leafmould or compost and plant a bed of snowdrops (you can lift and divide them now), violets, primroses, wood anemones, hardy cyclamen and miniature daffodils such as N. Tete a Tete (use the ones you had in pots on the windowsill)  for an early flower and N. Hawera for later. Keep well watered and enjoy every spring!\r\n"},
{"nid":"119","title":"Woodland gardening and Beth Chatto","type":"blog","created":"1430434800","body_value":"A new friend walked round ‘Charnwood’ with me in March and kindly commented on how she appreciated the naturalistic style of planting; ‘a woodland garden’ was her description. Those of you who read this column regularly will know that this is a big compliment – I am not in the ‘neat’ or ‘formal’ garden fan club. That’s not to say that, if you like it neat, I am right and you are wrong; one of the fun things about gardening is that we all do it in different ways. Not all of us are verging on being obsessive about plants like me; most of you are much better balanced human beings. The trick is to combine your favourite plants in an overall scheme that works for you, your family and your pets. Dogs and cats in my experience aren’t fab gardeners. We have a large brown dog who, however many times I tell him, has no regard for the fact that ‘Charnwood’ has been in the NGS for 4 years in the past and even on East Midlands Today!\r\n\r\nEarly last month we had a lovely long weekend on the east coast when we managed to fit in a visit to Beth Chatto’s garden near to Colchester. If you share my love of woodland gardens, go and see it, it is absolutely wonderful. She also has a dry, gravel garden where bright, acid green euphorbias were looking lovely next to the brightly coloured spring bulbs.\r\n\r\nBut it is the woodland that draws me in. In early April it is quite understated, but still very beautiful. Big, mature trees are underplanted with smaller trees and shrubs including dogwoods, Corylopsis, flowering currant in pink and white, holly and Amalanchier. Generous drifts of bulbs and herbaceous perennials are lower still – wood anenomes, a delightful dwarf daffodil N.Minor, pulmonaria, primroses and dog tooth violets (pictured). I could go on, but you get the idea. I could have stayed there all day; it was so peaceful and gorgeous. There is an on line nursery, I can recommend www.bethchatto.co.uk and the plants often unusual and of excellent quality. One I had not come across before ‘Mathiasella bupleuroides ‘Green Dream’ has now taken up residence in my garden. Described as ‘looking a bit like a tall green hellebore, flowers April to June that gradually turn pink, Elegant’. Who could resist?!\r\n\r\nGarden visiting is surely one of the best ways to spend a couple of hours. The National Gardens Scheme is a charity set up to enable garden owners to open their gardens. There is a robust selection process so you can be pretty sure of a good experience. You can see what is open in your area via the website www.ngs.org.uk or you can pick up the local NGS brochures in garden centres, or buy the whole book covering the whole country in bookshops. A new one opening locally this year is Rose Cottage  at 81 Nottingham Road Keyworth. The description begins: ‘Small cottage garden with informal planting and a private enclosed feel. A pebble mosaic, water feature with a Victorian pump, and original brick well all add unique interest…’\r\n \r\nOpen on the afternoon of 31 May with another garden close by, it sounds well worth a visit. Enjoy!\r\n"},
{"nid":"120","title":"Poppies","type":"blog","created":"1434300899","body_value":"At the time of writing this – mid May – the oriental poppies are coming into bud. They are so quickly over I vow every year to look them out every day to make sure I enjoy every minute of their short lives. My best laid plans to stake them properly and effectively early in May have been forgotten as usual ; the best way when I have got round to it is to use brushwood stuck into the ground around and between them. It disappears as the poppies grow up and looks more natural than those green wirey jobs.\r\nOriental poppies are of the perennial, herbaceous variety. That means they come up every year from a strong root and die down in winter. They usually are a fabulous bright, shocking red (pictured), but you can find pink and white varieties. ‘Perry’s White’ was found by nurseryman Amos Perry.  When a customer contacted him to complain that a poppy he had brought from him in good faith as pink turned out to be white, he acted quickly. He sped over, gave the customer his money back, dug it up and took it away to propagate from it. I have one here at ‘Charnwood’, it is lovely, with a crimson splodge in the centre. But I admit to liking the bold and brash red ones best.\r\nAlthough they only last a short time in flower, you can use the space afterwards  by cutting them hard down to the ground and planting annuals such as cosmos around them. They won’t mind at all and will grow a lovely green crown of new leaves in time, ready for next year.  In my experience they are quite hard to propagate from as they have a long, fleshy root so take a while to settle down if you move them. The usual way of propagating oriental poppies is from root cuttings, again not the easiest or quickest way to get new plants but worth a try if you want more and are prepared to give it a whirl. Early winter is the best time.\r\nTalking of annuals I have managed to grow some Cleomes this year. They are a rather unusual, fairly tall and elegant plant, their common name is spider flower. The instructions on the seed packet were rather involved, so I risked a simple sowing in a seed tray and stuck them in my unheated greenhouse. They germinated really well, so it just goes to show, you don’t have always have to faff about for good results. Mine are C. Violet Queen described as; \r\nEyecatching and strongly-scented (can’t say I noticed that) the deep violet flowers and palm-like leaves of this beautiful plant will add a tropical look to the late summer garden. Great for adding vertical interest to a perennial border, the spidery flowers will also make attractive cut flowers. The seed heads can be dried and added to bouquets, too.\r\nIt’s a bit late to sow them now, but I have bought them off the excellent  garden club plant stall at the village event  or at a good plant nursery. By that I mean one that sells a wide range of reasonably priced well grown plants rather than barbeques the size of a small car or nasty jumpers. (Sorry, starting to rant…).\r\nJune is such a lovely month, so take the time out to sit in your garden and enjoy!\r\n"},
{"nid":"121","title":"Fab foliage for impact","type":"blog","created":"1437999748","body_value":"It’s easy at this time of year to appreciate the gorgeous flowers in our gardens. Roses, clematis, annuals such as Cosmos and Nicotiana to name a few are looking lovely right now and give our eyes and noses a visual and fragrant treat.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I’d spare a thought to those plants that give us a longer term back bone to our beds and borders, foliage plants that provide a much needed foil to all that bright colour. It’s been said about the white garden at Sissinghurst that it’s not just a white garden, and that is its strength. That’s because it also has grey and green leaves in abundance. I’ve seen a garden set out in all white flowers and it looked completely OTT, like an accident between a meringue mountain and a milk float. Sissinghurst has clipped box edges, grasses and  grey leaved stachys among other things setting off the lilies and roses. The balance between leaf colour and the bright, sometimes in-yer-face shiny white is perfectly judged and creates  lovely calm space.\r\n\r\nHostas are an obvious candidate to provide drama and a cooling green contrast to a flower border. Actually they do flower and these can even be fragrant, but it’s their leaves that pack a punch and have longevity. We have a big group of H. ’Sum and Substance’ underplanting a gold stemmed bamboo (pictured);  no flowers at all but it’s one of my favourite combos for colour, scale and overall impact. If you struggle to stop the slugs, this is a good one to grow as it’s so big and tough they can struggle to get their teeth round it. No promises though! Or you could try Rodgersia. It has beautiful big, slightly hairy leaves and does the job a hosta does with no slug damage. They like similar conditions, light shade and damp-ish soil.\r\nFor drier and sunnier conditions, grey foliage is often a good choice. Stachys byzantia, or to use its common name, lambs’ ears, is a really useful edging plant for a hot and sunny border, and the bees love it. It does flower about now, and so is best cut hard back in a month or so when it will grow fresh, new ground hugging leaves. It was one of Getrude Jekyll’s favourite plants as it is so versatile and easy to grow. Artemisia is a big family of mainly, but not exclusively, grey plants, A. ‘Powis Castle’ is one of the best with fair sized and pretty wavy edged leaves. Goes well with colourful annuals such as Cosmos and doesn’t usually flower so stays looking good for a long while.\r\nFor a more tropical effect go for a Yucca. They are hardy and dramatic; just watch out for their spikey leaves which can do you real damage if you fall on one. Some folk cut off their spikey ends but I think it spoils their look so place them carefully at the back out of harm’s way. Yucca are much better than Phormiums in my view, which very quickly get brown and tatty in a cold and windy spell. I’ve got a Chilean glory vine scrambling through a variegated yucca at Charnwood; the orange flowers and ferny leaves contrast really well with the large spikes of the Yucca.\r\nI wouldn’t be without Alchemilla Mollis. I know it seeds everywhere and can be a bit of a pest as a result, but it’s a brilliant in-filler, softening paths and edges. It’s is also great in a vase with almost any other flower, a Godsend to a rubbish flower arranger like me.\r\n"},

{"nid":"123","title":"Summer borders and 'Dark Plum' poppy","type":"blog","created":"1441062000","body_value":"In June we had a week’s holiday in the Ashdown Forest. I made my usual pilgrimage to Great Dixter, which was looking fantastic, full of vibrant colour that makes you  feel immersed rather than a mere spectator. The meadow was past its colourful best but still very beautiful with soft pink and beige grasses taking over from the early summer wildflowers. Just a few orchids were still evident, and wild blue geranium dotted about .\r\n\r\nFor sheer contrast I visited Nymans. Also very beautiful but very tidy, almost manicured in places, the typical National Trust style of lovely colour themed planting in large blocks of beautifully grown plants, all  for maximum impact. There is a magnificent, generously proportioned double sided ‘June border’ 0f mainly herbaceous perennials  that looked fantastic at the end of the month. My favourite planting combo was a clear blue, large flowered hardy geranium ‘Orion’ scrambling up to a soft orange alstromeria; both reaching 4 or 5 feet tall. Down the backside (so to speak) of one of the borders are dogwoods. Not the usual multi stemmed variety but big trees full of their simple white flowers. They make a wonderful backdrop in or out of flower.\r\n\r\nThe summer border has tall perennials such as heleniums at the back, and at the front, tender annuals including nicotania, cleome and tagetes. All planted out in carefully colour themed groups looking rather staid and geometric, but clearly that effect will by now have given way to a spectacular show as it all grows up and outwards. Quite, quite different from the organised chaos of Dixter where plants weave in and out of the borders,  but still very lovely. In the Nymans walled garden was the most delicious looking dark purple annual poppy planted right next to a bright silver sea holly. I asked the name of it and a kind volunteer gardener found  it – Papaver somniferum ‘Dark Plum’. It’s in the Sarah Raven catalogue if you fancy it. It’s a tall, annual poppy so you can just scatter the seed in Autumn or early spring wherever you want them and thin them out when they come through to get better plants free of mildew. They don’t transplant very well, especially if you have Mars Bar fingers like me. I think the sea holly was Miss Willmots Ghost, a biannual that also will seed around.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly there is the Nymans rose garden. I’m not usually a great fan of just roses together, but the sheer scale, scent and planting is fabulous, especially this year, which has been such a good one for them.   So if you are in the area go to Nymans - and Great Dixter of course!\r\n\r\nDon’t forget to keep deadheading your plants to keep them flowering. It is especially needed with sweet peas, which will stop flowering if you let them make pods and set seed. Last year I actually got round to sowing my sweet peas in October, and they have made much better, stronger plants. So that is another gardening lesson learned. That’s one great thing about gardening as in life, there is always something new to learn if you are willing to try!\r\n"},
{"nid":"124","title":"Getting ready for winter","type":"blog","created":"1443654000","body_value":"Now is a good time to take stock in the garden – what worked well, what didn’t,  were there any gaps in the borders that need planning for more carefully? I’m heavily into succession planning so there is colour in as many places as possible all year. But it is hard to get it right all, or even most of the time, so here are some of my tips to keep your garden in good order with some  colour all season next year:\r\n\r\n•\tOrder a good number of spring bulbs: a decent show is much better that a few dotted around. I get mine from de Jager, but there are plenty of options on line and in the shops. If you have a new garden, or are not sure where to plant them, put them in pots. Next year when they have flowered you will be able to see more clearly where to put them;\r\n•\tGet some early spring bedding in now. It is often called winter bedding, which I think is a cheat as plants rarely do really well over the worst of the winter, pansies being the biggest culprit. In my view primrose and polyanthus are much nicer, but whatever takes your fancy!\r\n•\tThen think about what may follow on. You can order plug plants of loads of tender plants such as nicotania, tagetes, pelargoniums, to arrive next Spring;\r\n•\tOr if you like growing from seed have a browse through the seed catalogues. It’s too early to sow now in most cases, but you can start to plan;\r\n•\tIn a spell of mild weather lift and divide any perennials that are running out of steam. Throw away the woody middles, dig in some compost and replant in generous clumps and they will flower much better for the next few years. Day lillies, hardy geranium and phlox are some of the good candidates for this treatment but most herbaceous plants enjoy being refreshed in this way. You can plant spring bulbs among them for a bit of early colour;\r\n•\tSow some sweet pea seeds now. I did so this time last year and got much bigger and better plants that flowered really early and kept going for ages. You will have to keep an eye on them and keep the mice off the new shoots though, the little critters love ‘em;\r\n•\tWhen you are weeding watch out for self seeders such as forget me nots, poppies and foxgloves. They will bulk up nicely if you thin them out a bit and weed around them to give them some space, at least a hand span between each plant is best;\r\n•\tIf we get some decent rain, give your borders a good mulch to keep the weeds down and the moisture in. I use garden compost if I’ve got it, but it can be a bit weedy so have a look out for products such as Strulch which will save you from so much weeding!\r\n\r\nDahlias have been fabulous this year, I’ve remembered to keep dead heading them and they have flowered and flowered and flowered. Once the frost blackens the tops is the time to dig the tubers up and get them in a frost free place. Keep them dry-ish over the winter and keep an eye on them and they will do you proud again next year. You can leave them in the ground, but they are not reliably hardy and hate long, wet and cold winters. But if you run out of steam and decide to risk it, tip a load of compost or grit over their crowns and say a little prayer!\r\n"},
{"nid":"125","title":"Late season colour","type":"blog","created":"1448820342","body_value":"This is the time of year I wish I’d planted more for autumn and winter interest. A bit of forward planning goes a long way in the garden (and elsewhere I guess!) but it’s hard when the season is 12 months long and varies hugely depending on the weather, rampaging wildlife and our lack of spare time and energy. Hey ho.\r\n\r\nHaving said that we do have some late season stars here at Charnwood. One I’m gazing at right now is the dwarf Japanese Cherry,  grown up name Prunus incisa ‘Kojo-no-mai’. If you read this column regularly you may be tired of my plugs for this lovely small tree, but I ask you:  have you planted one yet? It stands about 3.5 metres tall here at around 20 years old. In spring it has the most gorgeous almond pink flowers on bare, twisty branches. Right now its leaves are red, yellow and soft orange,  like a cross between a bonfire and a firework. Close by is a group of bright pinky purple Autumn Crocus , not actually a crocus but a Colchicum. These are dead easy bulbs that nothing seems to eat, not even the pesky squirrels,  and they flower year on year getting bigger and better.  They prefer a sunny spot and some decent soil.\r\n\r\nFor brightly coloured stems in winter the multi stemmed dogwoods take some beating. The family is Cornus and it’s a big ‘un; there are large, flowering trees right down to little knee high shrubby ones. I’m talking here about the multi stemmed shrubs that glow bright all through winter. There are pink, red and yellow coloured types and most are unfussy about soil or site.  Once they are established you can prune them hard back in early April to keep the new, bright stems coming.  I cut back about a third of the stems just above the ground each year but it’s up to you and your space. If you give them a feed after pruning they will love you and keep going longer. I have a variegated leaf one called ‘Elegantissima’ that has real presence all through the summer too and looks lovely next to a red leafed Berberis.\r\n\r\nFor bright, in yer face red autumn colour try a Euonymus. Not the nasty little variegated blobs you see in municipal planting, but the small trees such as Euomymus alatus. Both that and the dogwoods are easily found in garden centres. I’ve recently paid a visit to the Six Acre nursery in Costock and have been really impressed with the range and quality of the plants. It has a café with good cake too!\r\n\r\nGrasses can be a feature in autumn and winter too. Not all last beyond late summer and some descend into mush as soon as the frost and winter rain comes, but I’ve Miscanthus  called ‘sliver stripe’ (pictured) that looks fabulous in autumn; it  grows to  just over a metre. Grasses are best planted and, if need be, lifted and divided in Spring when you can just see the first green blades coming up.\r\n\r\n"},
{"nid":"126","title":"Stoneywell and Christmas presents","type":"blog","created":"1450549586","body_value":"In October we visited a National Trust property newly opened in Markfield, just outside Loughborough called Stoneywell. It is really unusual, partly because of the viewing arrangements. Parking is in a field about half a mile away, and you get ferried to it by minibus. You then have a guided tour of this small but fascinating place. It was owned by the Gimson family, one of whom lived it until very recently. It is described as Arts and Crafts, all the furniture and decorations are very much in that style, so it has  a light and airy, rather peaceful atmosphere. The house itself is a short walk from the road and is built into the side of a stony hill, so on one side it looks like a single storey building. The guides are very knowledgeable about the house and the family’s history and you will need to allow about 45 minutes for the tour alone. The grounds are wild but beautiful; lovely trees, heather and bracken, all in typical, gently rolling Leicestershire countryside. Stoneywell also does good cake, crucial to any visit. If you have a disability or are not very mobile it would be worth asking about access as the stairs are very narrow and steep. The website where you can book is http:\/\/www.nationaltrust.org.uk\/stoneywell or you can book by ‘phone: 01530 248040. Booking is essential, you can’t go on spec but it is open all year round.\r\n\r\nOutside the front door was an evergreen bush I kind of recognised as a myrtle but wasn’t sure. It turned out to be a small leaved myrtle. The tour guide (rather surreptitiously so don’t tell) pulled me off a tiny cutting which has survived so far. I cut the end off cleanly below a leaf and stripped the lower leaves off when I got back and popped it in a pot in some gritty compost. I’ll keep it damp but not too wet overwinter in a frost free place in gentle light.  I have a common myrtle outside my back door (pictured): its leaves have a wonderful scent and the flowers are little and very pretty. The big flush arrives  in summer and then they carry on, albeit sporadically, right through until now. It makes a decent hedge too I’m told.\r\n\r\nI mention Stoneywell here because in my humble opinion we aren’t very well served for NT properties in our neck of the woods. In my quest to come up with unusual and helpful suggestions for Christmas presents, National Trust membership may be a good one? Hidcote is not that far away and is a gorgeous garden, and there are Belton House and Clumber Park to name a couple more. If you spend a week away down south you can get your money’s worth from membership easily in a week but that may or may not be an option for you.\r\n\r\nA good gardening book, with a glass or two of something tasty, will keep me happy and reasonably quiet through a good chunk of Christmas. Two RHS books caught my eye while browsing – ‘Botany for Gardeners’ and ‘Latin for Gardeners’. The first is ‘written for those interested in gardening but ‘with a desire to dip a toe into the science behind plant’. The second is self-explanatory: both are well illustrated and cost £14.99. I’m a big fan of Vita Sackville West and her book simply titled ‘Some Flowers’ is available again. First published in 1937 it is £9.99 and describes 25 of her favourite flowers, all beautifully illustrated. A couple of stocking fillers: ‘How to Cook Compost’ is a guide to making the fab stuff from the National Trust at £5.99  and a little green book entitled ‘Inspiration for Gardeners at £4.99. The last book is full of quotes from the wise including this from JK Phillips: ‘There are no gardening mistakes, only experiments’. Hear, hear to that!  \r\n\r\n"},

{"nid":"137","title":"We've been married for 40 years this month. Blimey.","type":"blog","created":"1464943418","body_value":"It’s our 40th wedding anniversary this month. Can’t believe it really. I now know my lovely old Dad was spot on when he told me many years ago that the older you get the quicker the time flies by. Peter has just been playing some 70s music including Barclay James Harvest on a proper long playing record, just two tracks per side of 20 minutes, fab. We had Cat Stevens (as he was called then) ‘Morning has Broken’ as part of our wedding service as did many of our mates who got married in the mid seventies. Takes you back.\r\nI had mock orange blossom in my hair when I got married. It wilted a bit, especially by my third glass of champagne, but I still love it, especially the fragrance, and we have several bushes in the garden.  The most frequently planted is probably the double flowered Philadelphus 'Virginal' but the single flowered version is just as lovely. There are also dwarf versions and ones with paler leaves. Neither are to be confused with Choisya which I’m much less of a fan of, especially that nasty gold leaved version, but I know I am in the minority there!  As with most spring\/early summer flowering shrubs, they do get a bit congested eventually and benefit from a proper prune and a good feed after flowering.  \r\nRed roses and stephanotis were in my wedding bouquet.  I had a go at growing a stephanotis but failed, I think you need a conservatory to do it justice but please let me know if you have had more success. Red roses are much easier:  my favourite it the Gallica rose ‘Tuscany Superb’ (pictured). It is an old rose, so only flowers once but it is so worth it. Its petals are like velvet and it is the most gorgeous ruby red. It smells wonderful  too. It’s a bit gawky in the border, so I have it underplanted with a pink scrambling hardy geranium. As long as you feed them both well, they will thrive together as close companions. \r\n\r\nAnother shrub, and one often overlooked but worthy of wider planting in my humble opinion, is Berberis. We have a few bushes here and they are trouble free and make good companions to other plants. You can trim them hard and  even make a hedge of them. They are a bit spikey so can deter folk making an unwelcome entry to your garden, or you can leave them to grow more naturally as a backdrop in a mixed border. I have a great combo at Charnwood, red leaved Berberis (‘Harlequin’ from memory) underplanted with orange lilies, with a stripy leaved grass, a Miscanthus I think. It all works well, is reasonably trouble free apart for the bloomin’ red lily beetle, and lasts a long while looking good. Berberis have a dainty little orange flowers in summer.\r\n\r\nI feel like I’ve been weeding forever! It’s good to keep on top of it if you can but it is hard to keep up I know. This year I’ve bought more bark chippings for a generous mulch. It stops annuals from self seeding which is a bit of a shame, but it has helped me keep on top of some areas. Gravel or mushroom compost will do the same job.\r\n"},
{"nid":"130","title":"Beautiful horse poo","type":"blog","created":"1456057914","body_value":"You don’t need me to tell you the weather has been bonkers this winter. I can remember some odd flowering companions in the past, but I have never had snowdrops, daffodils, tender salvias from Mexico and delphiniums all out at the same time. See the photo taken on 9 January. It’s not a magnificent specimen I grant you, but it is a delphinium flower spike nevertheless. \r\nThe weird weather has caused me a dilemma. Peter bought me 40 bags of beautiful, well rotted manure for Christmas*. I know not every wife would welcome bags of horse s**t for Christma from her husband, but it made me very happy. But – and here lies the problem – if I put it on now and it suddenly turns very cold later on, will it cause leggy growth that gets struck by frostbite? For all I know, when you read this in this great newsletter, we may be a foot deep in snow.\r\nHey ho, what would we have to talk about and look forward to if we didn’t have seasons with unpredictable weather? And I do love the fact we have really different seasons in England where plants do different things at different times. That’s why I would never have a garden just full of evergreens that look pretty much the same all year round. Also it’s why I don’t mind messy leaves – they look so lovely on the tree from early spring through to leaf drop. I even like their bright colours when they have fallen onto the weedy grass that passes for lawn here at Charnwood. Spring bulbs the same – what does it matter if they die a bit messily? Plant them among other plants that will cover them up when they are done – daffodils and snowdrops among hostas is a good combo. Neat isn’t everything…\r\nI thought I was getting ahead and planted some sweet peas in the Autumn. It did cheer me up, a nod towards Spring on a cold dark evening. It was an old packet, so I should have been less cocky, but I only got one plant through. So I will very soon be sowing some more. If you sow them now you will get really strong plants. Put three or four seeds into a 3” pot and pinch the tops out when they are growing well . Plant them out in well manured soil undisturbed as they are in the pot, sweet peas are hungry and thirsty plants and don’t like their roots being messed about. They are a bit hardy so you don’t have to wait til the frosts are done. Needless to say some of my Christmas present will be saved for their sustenance!\r\nI’ve just cut some old lavender back, quite hard but not too far into the old wood. It’s a risk at this time of year, or at least that’s what I’ve read, but I can’t say I have ever lost a lavender through pruning it too hard. I’m late doing it partly because I didn’t have the time in late summer after flowering, but also because flower spikes kept coming right up until November. I’m talking about the old fashioned Angustifolia with a rangy growth and tall, pale lavender flowers. I know most of us plant the newer varieties such as the gorgeous deep lavender ‘Hidcote’ which is more compact. But there is something about the old fashioned elegance of the old variety that I love. The cuttings came from plants in my Mum’s garden, so that makes them extra special.\r\n"},
{"nid":"136","title":"March jobs in the garden","type":"blog","created":"1456790400","body_value":"March is the best month to get out into the garden. Time spent now will pay huge dividends later in the year. Halt your gym membership, don your wellies and pick up your border fork!  Here are a few suggestions:\r\n\r\n•\tWeed your borders. Perennial weeds such as dandelions and bindweed need to be dug up carefully and put in your green bin or burned.  If you leave a tiny bit of root, they will come back. Annual weeds such as chickweed are a pain, but are easy to pull up or hoe. Once clear, give the area a good mulch with bark chippings, gravel or better still compost  to prevent seedlings from germinating and you should be reasonably weed free for several weeks at least;\r\n•\tNow is a good time for planting most flowering plants, shrubs and trees, as long as no frost is forecast and they are hardy. Don’t make the mistake of letting the garden centres seduce you into buying your bedding plants too early unless you can mollycoddle them in a frost free greenhouse until May at the earliest;\r\n•\tMarch is also a good month for pruning clematis. It can seem complicated so if in doubt check out the RHS website www.rhs.org.uk where there are clear instructions. Clematis love a good water and mulch at this time of year, and a handful of sulphate of potash or wood ash;\r\n•\tIf your multi stemmed dogwood is looking a bit messy and the coloured stems are a bit dull, you can prune it really hard back to a bud now. If that’s too drastic for you, prune around a third of it and, after three years, you will have completely rejuvenated your plant. Give it a feed and you will be rewarded with some bright new stems. The drastic pruning method  works for several shrubs including the shrubby willows (salix),  catalpa and cotinus for bigger leaves;\r\n•\tBuddleia also benefits from a hard prune now: aim to leave a strong, short framework of branches around 30 cm above the ground, or taller if you want more height;\r\n•\tDead head your daffodils and give them a foliar feed, don’t cut them back or tie them into knots, they hate it and may sulk next year.  Split and divide your snowdrops if you want to make a bigger show in future years.\r\n\r\nThis is the time of year I wish I had planted loads more flowering trees and shrubs, they are so beautiful and lift the spirits in early spring. A beautiful, slow growing cherry graces our back lawn, Prunus ‘Shogetsu’ longipes (pictured). After around 15 years, and in a rather exposed spot, it’s grown here at Charnwood to about 2 metres. I looked it up on the RHS site and it says its ultimate height is around 4 or 5 metres. It has a beautiful, spreading habit so there is no need for pruning. Cherries hate it anyway and always look horrid when pruned into a lollipop! The buds start out pink and gradually open into gorgeous white, exuberant bunches. \r\n\r\nFor perfume in spring we’ve a Virburnum x juddi. It’s no drama queen, more of a gently pretty kind of plant, but it makes its presence felt by its beautifully scented flowers  that pervade the whole garden. Again it’s a compact shrub, fine for a small garden. \r\n\r\nHere’s to a beautiful, warm spring so we can all enjoy our gardening!\r\n"},
{"nid":"135","title":"Garden visiting - lessons learned!","type":"blog","created":"1462057200","body_value":"Last month I spent a lovely couple of days with a mate visiting gardens down south. We planned to see two gardens specifically, Sissinghurst and Great Dixter.  They are quite different in style – Sissinghurst is much more manicured, each ‘garden room’ clearly delineated with a theme and a complementary colour theme – the White Garden, the Lime Walk, The Purple border.  Dixters’ design is a bit more fluid, planted more densely and with colours that sing out in contrast to shock as well as impress.\r\n\r\nBut both had a thing or two to teach us about how to plant and display plants. Some lessons learned or remembered:\r\n\r\n•\tPlant spring bulbs in generous drifts. In my humble opinion the smaller headed, paler varieties of daffodils look best in meadow type settings, bold giants such as ‘King Alfred’ have their place but not in naturalistic drifts in grass;\r\n•\tPlant tulips through the borders , be prepared to replant every year as they tend to disappear. They prefer well drained soil;\r\n•\tPlant snakes head fritillaries, they are wonderful;\r\n•\tDon’t prune your shrub roses to death. Take out the dead and overlapping stems to leave an open, clean plant with long stems. Gently pull each stem over and down a little into a semi circle and tie them to a rustic stake. You will get flowers all along the branch and it will look better, mulch thickly, preferably with well rotted manure;\r\n•\tPlant snakes head fritillaries;\r\n•\tFill gaps in your borders now with hardy annuals and perennials. At Dixter they plant red tulips among new lupin plants. It’s a good combo now, and when the tulips finish the lupins will take over the space;\r\n•\tPlant more snakes head fritillaries;\r\n•\tPosition generous  groups of pots together in one place rather than spread out in rows. The impact is magnificent and, if you plan ahead a bit, you can keep it looking fresh for ages. It’s easier to water and feed too. Shrubs, bulbs and  bedding plants all make good candidates for a while in a pot;\r\n•\tPlant even more snakes head fritillaries (I may have mentioned that already, but they are wonderful).\r\n\r\nI guess the message here if you are interested in being a bit more creative in your outside space, do some garden visiting to get inspired. Even if a garden is vast and has the advantage of professional gardeners, there is always something you can realistically take back to your own plot. The National Gardens Scheme has a good website that will show you where is open locally: 7 Collygate in Kimberly is lovely and open in May but there are several, especially if you are prepared to travel a few miles. www.ngs.org.uk  \r\n\r\nTake the time to enjoy your garden at this wonderful time of year.\r\n"},
{"nid":"138","title":"Plants that do it by themselves...","type":"blog","created":"1469358150","body_value":"Many years ago I bought a small pot of a pretty little blue plant called Pratia pedunculata. A member of the campanula family, it has that gorgeous soft sky blue you seldom find in flowers. This one is very low growing, only around one or two centimetres (less than an inch in old money). I  I bought it to soften the edge of a pond.\r\nThe aforementioned pond is now well gone, but while I wasn’t paying attention the little monkey of a plant crept slowly but determinedly towards the grass. Incidentally I now longer use the term ‘lawn’ to describe the bits Peter does on the ride on mower. It is full of weeds and moss but it is green and it mows so does the same job without throwing endless chemicals at it. But I digress….\r\nSo now the little green patch outside our study window has been transformed into a delightful sprinkling of campanula blue little Pratia stars among the green. I love it. Peter mows it occasionally but it sees him coming and tucks itself low under the mower blades and bounces back beautifully when he has gone. It struck me when thinking about what to write this month that in this garden at any rate, a lot of the decisions as to where and what to plant aren’t actually made by me, or any human come to that. Not that I am against thinning out self seeders ruthlessly, and I do plan a border to some extent to provide a bit of structure. But plants that seed around or those that rampage beyond their allotted space often look much better than a carefully planted out border. Foxgloves, forget me nots,  poppies of various types (annual poppy pictured) , that lovely bronze fennel, verbena bonariensis, aquilegias, alchemilla mollis and that lovely little white and pinky erigeron that seeds beautifully into cracks in the paving to name a few, all pop up all over our garden. It is important to make sure they don’t crowd out your treasures, and if you don’t thin them out to give them a bit of space between each seedling you risk them getting congested and full of mildew. But apart from that you can let them get on with it.\r\nOn a much grander scale I am loving our swamp cypress. Its grown up name is Taxodium Distichum and it is a very tall tree when full grown, but has a fairly slender girth so it would fit in a relatively small space. It needs damp, even soggy soil to thrive. In Spring, the light apple-green leaves appear on twisted stems and by Autumn the foliage turns a deep fox-fur russet before it loses its leaves. If planted on the edge of a pond it will throw up tree roots that buckle up above the surface into knobbly 'knees', known as pneumatophores. No one is quite sure why they do this, one suggestion is that they take oxygen down to the roots to prevent them from drowning by allowing them to breathe. Tiny or huge, aren’t plants marvellous?\r\n\r\nGaps in the border where soil can be seen are not allowed at Charnwood. So I’ve planted tobacco plants, snapdragons, fuchsia and dahlias where the early spring flowers have now gone. It’s not too late to do this and it works with most bedding plants. You can be sure of colour until the frosts then with just a little bit of extra work now and remember: bare soil will harbour weeds!\r\nEnjoy the summer in your garden, it’s over all too soon!\r\n"},
{"nid":"134","title":"My favourite garden writing for April","type":"blog","created":"1459465200","body_value":"I love the garden in April. So much promise, masses of green shoots and buds, all fresh and new, not too many weeds, the clocks have moved on so the light evenings are longer, wonderful.\r\n\r\nGardening books are a passion of mine, I’ve often got my nose in one, sometimes when I’m supposed to be doing other things, especially cleaning. So this month, I’m taking you through a journey through some of my bookshelves to see what other, more eloquent and knowledgeable gardeners (surely not I hear you cry?) have said at this time of year:\r\n\r\n‘I have just seen the most beautiful flowering tree in my life. It  was  a cherry, Prunus ‘Tahaku’ with a short trunk from which spread half a dozen strong branches… to span an area of perhaps thirty feet across. .. on the end of each one was a bundle of huge white blossom, hanging like delicate explosions caught and frozen in mid air’\r\n\r\nMonty Don, The Ivington Diaries\r\n\r\n‘The garden in April can be fickle – blue skies one minute and the next the light turns menacingly yellow, the sun almost doused by black thunderclouds. The garden changes minute by the minute, by the hour.. driven by the urgency of Spring. To miss even a day is a loss..’\r\n\r\nBeth Chatto’s Woodland Garden\r\n\r\nHow about this, stay calm those of you who are obsessed with a perfect, weed free lawn:\r\n\r\n‘Moss doesn’t create a situation, it merely expresses one. That situation may itself be harmful, as in a broadly drained lawn or it may indicate that, other competitors being in abeyance and the weather right for it, moss is enjoying itself. And why not? Nearly all mosses are pleasant to look at.’\r\n\r\nIn My Garden, Christopher Lloyd\r\n\r\nAnd finally my favourite garden quote of all time from one of my favourite garden books of all time:\r\n\r\nIf a garden isn’t shaggy, forget it’ -      Derek Jarman’s Garden\r\n\r\nThe mild weather has meant that at least some of our spring flowering bulbs have done their thing much earlier. We usually have daffodils flowering here at Charnwood until early June. I doubt we will have this year though. I love daffodils and have planted large numbers of many different varieties. One that is a bit later is N. ‘Thalia’ (pictured).  She is a multi stemmed, white flowering beauty with a strong, musky kind of scent. Thalia is elegance personified and flowers reliably every year.\r\n"},
{"nid":"139","title":"Salvia and compost","type":"blog","created":"1471635171","body_value":"One really good plant for late summer colour is Salvia. This is the same family  as the sage we use in cooking, but it is a vast genus. I’m not so keen on the dumpy little bedding ones that you see in bright colours, often set out in more formal planting schemes. I’m talking about the perennial salvias. Many are tender, originating in Mexico, so need to be given frost free shelter over the winter. I have a gorgeous red flowered one, its flowers look like they are made out of velvet. I keep it in a pot so I can pop it in the greenhouse, it has survived and thrived like that for a couple of years but I think I may have to pot it on this year.\r\n\r\nThe one most easily available, and  fairly hardy, is S.x superba. It’s flowers are the most gorgeous, rich, deep  blue that combine wonderfully with most things. I have it next to a pale lemon Achillea with grey leaves, it looks lovely for a long while if deadheaded. Another gorgeous, rich blue one is S. guaranitica ‘Blue Enigma’. It stands around 6 feet tall in a good year, really striking. It sits next to a massive yellow flowered Inula here at Charnwood and stands its ground well. A third, softer and more purplely blue salvia is Purple Rain. \r\n\r\nThen there are the smaller, shrubbier versions. One that has been in vogue this last few years being S. ‘jamensis Hot Lips’.If you look closely it is not hard to see how it got its name! If you feed salvias and give them a sunny, sheltered spot they will flower from May to October.\r\n\r\nAugust and September are really good times to take cuttings. If you haven’t tried it before it is really easy and costs you nothing apart from a little compost and some TLC time. Geraniums (the tender pelargoniums) are the easiest of all. Cut off a stem roughly  5”\/ 12cm long, a non- flowering one if you can find one, strip off the bottom leaves and pop them around the edge of a pot of gritty compost. Keep them damp but not really wet or they will rot. Within a few weeks you will see little white roots coming out of the bottom of the pot. You can them re pot the cuttings individually and keep them frost free over the winter. Lavender, salvias, rosemary, shrubs such as box and myrtle, penstemons, diascia and fuchsias to name a few can all be raised this way. It does help if you pop a plastic bag over the top to keep humidity up, but I don’t usually bother and I get a good rate of success. Just  don’t let them dry out and mist the pot every day or so.  \r\n\r\nDon’t forget to keep your compost heaps going. A good mixture of grass clippings, shredded paper and general border tidying material is best so the heap stays not too dry but not too sodden either. Don’t put in perennial weeds. Many years ago I saw Geoff Hamilton re- plant a dock he had dug up and nailed to his garden shed a year beforehand; it regrew! Don’t add diseased plant material either, you may be spreading it round the garden. We put in our vegetable and fruit peelings too, but nothing cooked or you may get rats.Home made garden compost is magnificent stuff, it feeds the soil and improves the texture better than anything else. It’s free too! \r\n\r\nHere’s to a hot and dry August – we live in hope!\r\n"},
{"nid":"140","title":"Figs rule","type":"blog","created":"1475276400","body_value":"Not to boast (well, perhaps a bit) but we have a luxuriant, productive fig tree by our front door. The harvest this year was bountiful and is still going on. A fresh, ripe fig with some creamy yoghurt and honey is The Best Breakfast  Ever.  Not to be at all competitive, but I have several pals in the village who, quite frankly, don’t step up to the mark when it comes to the Good Fig Grower badge. So  I thought I’d try and find out why mine is so good and theirs isn’t. I’d like to say it is down to expertise and horticultural exellence but I can’t honestly say I’ve done much to deserve such a proud specimen of a fig tree. Apart from planting it next to a sheltered, sunny wall. And talking to it in an encouraging kind of way.\r\nOne down side is that it is now very big and makes it hard for us to see out of our kitchen window. It doesn’t bother me a fat lot being a mad fig lover, but Peter – who isn’t for some strange reason – keeps blobbing on about the size of the fig and consequent lack of daylight. So I thought I’d look up how to prune it. There lies a dilemma and a half.\r\nI was at Great Dixter ealier this year and they had a massive, beautifully fan trained fig growing up the very tall wall of a barn. It looked wonderful, a kind of stunning green sculpture. I asked a gardener there when they pruned it and he said ‘in the winter months’. When asked a further question about fruit he said that the harvest wasn’t their main aim, in other words, they risked losing  a decent fruit crop in exchange for a striking effect. I can see why that would matter at a garden open to the public, but no figs seems much too big a price to pay for a dramatic  spectacle in my garden.\r\nOne of the complications  is that figs form over a long period, but some will fruit and some won’t, depending on what size they are at what time of year. If, by the end of the summer, there are small to medium sized fruit left, you are supposed to remove the smallest ones as they will not ripen and will take vigour away from the plant. So you have to make a judgement as to which are too big to overwinter, and which are small enough to stay on and grow into yummy fruit next year. \r\nIn the end I think I’m going to use some common sense  and prune it so it gives us more light but not too drastically  so we get some fruit next year. \r\nYou can still take cuttings at this time of year. I’ve successfully raised penstemons, lavender, rosemary and myrtle in September and October. If you use gritty compost and keep them in a sheltered spot, damp but not sodden, they will produce roots and be good to plant in a pot of their own next Spring. I’m especially proud of our myrtle, the leaves smell gorgeous all the year round and the pretty white flowers arrive in early summer. It can be pruned too, even used as hedging. I grant you it isn’t 100% hardy and  may not come through a savage winter, so a few cuttings now kept frost free is good insurance.\r\n"},
{"nid":"141","title":"November cheer","type":"blog","created":"1477958400","body_value":"November can be a pretty dull and depressing month can’t it? Darker nights, colder, often wetter weather and all winter in front of us. So here are a few suggestions to make you and your garden more cheery when the sun isn’t shining:\r\n•\tPlant up a pot of scented plants right by your door. Pansies and violas have a lovely perfume – I much prefer the little violas best but each to their own. Other scented plants in winter include the winter flowering Virburnums – V. x bonantense Charles Lamont has an AGM and has pretty pink, scented flowers from October through to March. If you prefer an evergreen shrub,  Saraccoca confusa, sometimes called winter box, has fluffy white flowers and an amazing, all pervading scent. Finally Lonicera × purpusii 'Winter Beauty'  is a lovely  member of the honeysuckle family;\r\n•\tTrawl the garden centres for cheap bulbs – tulips can be planted now, they just come through a bit later. They too can be fragrant:  two beautifully elegant  lily flowered tulips are ‘West Point (yellow) and ‘Ballerina’ (a pretty, soft orange).  If squirrels are a pain – they seem to love to munch them, the more expensive and rare the better,  soak them in tonic water with quinine an hour or so before you  plant them. It keeps them away to some extent. Plant good and deep with a handful of grit for good drainage;\r\n•\tTurn your compost heap. It won’t just gladden your heart, it will do it good. And you will have the satisfaction of beautiful, crumbly, free  compost more quickly;\r\n•\tFind just the right spot for a comfy seat outside for when the weather is good enough for you to have your coffee or glass of wine. A little pot of something pretty, or fascinating like a houseleek will make you go out and enjoy the outside, even if you are huddled up in your coat;\r\n•\tFeed the birds. Do your bit for wildlife and give yourself some time to watch and enjoy!  If you don’t tidy your borders too much they will love it. I have a tall Inula outside the study window and I can watch the goldfinches eat the seeds for ages.\r\nThere are loads of jobs you can get on with at your own pace over the winter. I’m going to have a go at fan pruning our fig (see last months KC) without reducing the crop next year too much. Winter pruning fruit trees is an art I won’t try to describe here as I’m no expert, but it is a good time to do it when you can see the trees structure without leaves. The RHS website is always a good source of information. If you are planning some tree planting now is a good time. \r\nLeafmould is worth taking some time and effort to make. It does take a year or more to break down properly but it is beautiful stuff and easy to create. Rake up leaves when they are damp and pop them into a big bin bag. Make a few holes in the bottom for drainage,  they want to be damp but not sodden. Leave them somewhere out of the way until they have turned to crumbly, dark yumminess for your woodland plants to thrive in.\r\nPlease remember our pets and wildlife if you are planning a bonfire,  check especially for hedgehogs in the woodpile before you light up!\r\n"},
{"nid":"142","title":"Seasons Greetings from Charnwood!","type":"blog","created":"1483028239","body_value":"I’ve said this before on these pages, but will say it again - holly, or Ilex to give it its grown up name, is a much, underrated shrub.  It can brighten up a dull corner under trees on or the dark side of the house, you can prune it (carefully, with gloves!), cut lovely branches now to decorate the house and let it get on with growing with little or no work from you. Birds like the berries too and we get little seedlings dotted around the garden here that presumably come from beak or feathery bum. If I spot them before Peter gets out with the strimmer,  I pot them up, grow them on a bit so they can stand the wear and tear of living in our garden with rabbits and large dog, and then plant them along the back of the garden, they are not very fussy about soil. A couple have now made decent sized plants, admittedly after several years.   You are spoilt for choice for varieties – they come variegated, with red or yellow berries, some reasonably fast growing, other slow and compact. There is a column shaped one called ‘aquifolium’ ‘Pyramidalis’ and ‘Madam Briot is a hefty variety that makes a good hedge. If you want to make sure of berries you either need to plant a male and female variety within spitting distance, or chose a self fertile one such as ‘J.C.  van Tol’. If you are confused, go to a decent plant nursery as now is a good time to plant as long as you pick a mild spell. \r\n\r\nIvy is undersung as well (apart from in carols at Christmas) and can make a lovely feature. I’ve got ‘Sulphur Heart’ growing up the garage. It has big leaves with random yellow middles that really shine out this time of year. It makes good ground cover as long as you don’t let it travel everywhere and smother your treasured plants.\r\n\r\nAlso looking good here at Charnwood is our Mahonia. An unprepossessing, easy evergreen shrub also liking woodland conditions, it is coming into flower now with its gorgeous yellow scented spikes in profusion. If you have a shady corner where nothing much will grow, give it a go. It’s a fairly big plant and a bit prickly not unlike a holly so take that into account if you are planting it by a path.\r\n\r\nIn case you haven’t noticed, Christmas is nearly upon us. I still think the best Christmas present ever is a good gardening book. The one I have permanently at the side of my bed is Monty Don’s ‘Ivington Diaries. He is a wonderfully expressive writer so you learn a lot about his emotional journey through the year as well as how to be a better gardener. He also writes with both humour and humility, this is his entry for December 27 1998:\r\n‘What have I done in this or a previous life that merited being given spiked aerating sandals for Christmas? What bothers me most about this present … is not that they are absurd and the wearer instantly transformed into a puncturing buffoon, but that the giver might have been serious. .. The best presents of all – at any time of year – are plants from people’s gardens.. I love walking round the garden and remembering the provenance of plants.. . I like to think that the whole country has this interconnecting family tree of plants in gardened linking families, lovers and strangers alike.’\r\nSeasons greetings from Charnwood!\r\n"},
{"nid":"143","title":"Snowdrops, Helebores and weeds","type":"blog","created":"1486835665","body_value":"Snowdrops are so lovely, and so welcome this time of year. When time and energy allows we have very gently been increasing our coverage here by lifting and dividing a clump or two at this time of year and establishing them in another part of the garden. This is usually called ‘planting in the green’, meaning while they are still in leaf and it is the accepted way of planting snowdrops. A small clump can be divided into several smaller ones and will cover a wide area. This has the advantage of you being able to see clearly where the best spot is; for example you don’t want to put them on top of other emerging spring bulbs. In all honesty it is probably not the absolute best method for the plant, as it is a bit brutal to dig them up at this stage. As a result they take a year or two to settle down but that’s not the end of the world is it, and you will have them exactly where you want them. Buying the tiny bulbs  and planting in autumn hasn’t worked for me. They are often dried out and don’t do very well, and it’s easy to forget where they are later on!\r\n\r\nThere are many, many different kinds of snowdrops and you can pay a lot for some of the bigger varieties which are very lovely. My personal preference is for  generous sheets of the common, single version best, Galanthus nivalis. There is a double version of this common snowdrop which is also very pretty. There is loads of information on the internet – this is a good site to start: http:\/\/www.galanthus.co.uk\/\r\n\r\nHellebores should be strutting their stuff now. If the old leaves are looking a bit scruffy, or have brown patches, cut them off and burn them or pop in the green bin. The spots are a fungal disease called hellebore leaf spot so it’s best to keep it in check, and you will be able to see the lovely flowers much better. A mulch of leaf mould will make them very happy. Now we have a good number of established plants at Charnwood we do get a lot of seedlings, they are promiscuous!  It is fun to see what comes up – the new plants will be a mixed bag of flower colour. \r\n\r\nSome weeds seem to grow all year round don’t they? We have a problem at Charnwood with both creeping buttercups and nettles. Digging them up tests the back and the patience and getting their long roots out can take an age. It is worth keeping on top of it at this time of year though. Don’t put perennial weeds on the compost heap, they will love it and carry on growing!\r\n\r\nI didn’t get around to sowing sweet peas in the autumn so I will be getting on with it soon. They are really easy to get going and such lovely flowers, I plant 3 seeds to a small pot and keep them in a cool greenhouse: they don’t seem to be that fussy. Keep an eye on them a bit, the mice love the new shoots, and give them an occasional water and they will grow away quite happily.\r\n\r\nSpring is on the way – hooray!\r\n"},
{"nid":"144","title":"Clematis","type":"blog","created":"1488326400","body_value":"March to me is pruning month, the time to get out those secateurs and into the garden for a good old sort and tidy. Time spent now in the garden always pays off and prevents more work later on when things have grown and gone a bit wild.\r\nSo to clematis. Now don’t panic and please keep reading. It’s not as hard as some make out and the worst you can do is cut off potential flower buds for this year and, if that is the worst thing you do this year, it’s not that bad is it?\r\nIf you are planting new clematis, or did so last autumn, plant deep, give a good mulch and prune to a decent bud about 30cm (1 foot) from the ground. That way you will set it up to grow good, strong roots and many flowering stems. Keep it well watered and tie it in regularly.\r\nClematis fall into 3 groups: \r\nGroup 1: Those that flower in Spring such as C. montana, C alpina and C. armandii.  You don’t need to prune these at all (hooray!) but C. Montana especially can get huge and threaten the integrity of your gutters. So if you need to tidy it, do so in early summer after flowering. Then new shoots will grow and ripen and be ready to flower next year.\r\nGroup 2: these flower on shorter stems coming out of the previous seasons old wood. These tend to be larger flowering hybrids such as Nelly Moser and Vyvyan Pennell. They are less vigorous and need a gentler prune to a nice fat bud. I usually take them down to about three feet, but it will depend what your plant is growing up or through and what effect you want. \r\nGroup 3: These flower later on, some into the autumn, and the flowers come on the new wood produced this year. These should be cut down to about 30cm again to prevent all the flowers coming at the top of the plant. Don’t be tempted to prune too lightly or you will end up with loads of nasty brown tangly stems with flowers way above your head! C. Jackmanii and the lovely Viticellas fall into this group. The Viticellas are some of my favourite, such beautiful, elegant and dainty flowers, they are brilliant scramblers. Knocks the spots of the ubiquitous Nelly Moser any day in my book, but each to their own!\r\nThen give them all a feed, water and mulch. Clematis love potash so you can buy sulphate of potash and sprinkle that around before you water, or if you are burning some wood they love fresh (but not too hot!) wood ash. \r\nWe have loads of clematis at Charnwood. Some growing up through climbing roses, other scrambling up trees and a gorgeous larger flowered white one (sorry, name long forgotten) brightening up a Pyracantha in the summer. You always have space for a clematis! I have just bought a new one called Ernest Markham from Moores for a meagre £4.99. Lovely plant. He’s small so will take a couple of years to get going properly but patience is part of being a good gardener I’m afraid!\r\n"},
{"nid":"145","title":"Primroses, violets and cherries....","type":"blog","created":"1491001200","body_value":"The violets and primroses have been wonderful this year. I guess it’s because they prefer damp conditions – and they have certainly had that in recent months!\r\nWe brought some of the gorgeous, pale yellow native primroses to Charnwood when we moved up from the Isle of Wight in 1987. They have thrived; I can’t recall where I planted the original small clump, but they have happily and gently seeded themselves around and so pop up all over the garden. You can help them along a bit if you want more;  they can be gently lifted and divided into smaller clumps after they have flowered. Bear in mind they are a woodland plant, so prefer a fairly cool spot, not a dry bed in full sun. If you plant some at the top of a grassy bank, they will seed themselves downwards and look fabulous in a few years.\r\nThe violets are even better, white ones as well as the traditional violet\/blue. If you get down on your knees and look at them close up, they are fabulous, showy  little flowers with a lovely scent, hence their botanical name Viola odorata. \r\nThe dwarf Japanese cherry is just fabulous. I know I write about this often but I’m making no apology. It has such a delicate, frothy beauty. This morning as I write I can see it is full of bees. ‘Dwarf’  is a relative term in gardening I find, this tree currently stands at about 10 feet after around 25 years. Although the pale, almond pink blossom is fleeting, it has lovely autumn leaf colour and the twisty branches look good all winter. Its  grown up name is Prunus incisa ‘Kojo-no-mai’ and is easily available in garden centres. \r\nThe gullible – or is it optimistic – gardener that I am, I have purchased some lilies that are sold as being resistant to the red lily beetles. These pesky little things have been a real problem here, decimating pretty much every lily they can find. Now is the time to be vigilant, if you do a regular beetle patrol and get  rid now, the damage will be much  less. Watch out for their larvae, it does a good impression of bird poo and hides under the leaves. I’d recommend wearing rubber gloves to remove that gooey nastiness. I’m told they will have a go at fritillaries too so watch out! The lilies I’ve ordered by the way are pale pink and are from Thompson and Morgan called ‘Corsage’.\r\nThere is a rather soggy and windswept, but still very beautiful , group of daffodils outside the study window under the old apple trees. They are ‘Ice Follies’, as the name suggests they are a gentle creamy yellow. Several years ago they were looking a bit sad and some had given up flowering all together. So after they had flowered I deadheaded them, dug them up and replanted them with a bit more space and a handful of decent compost around them. They have rewarded my efforts by growing and increasing into a lovely show.\r\nThis is such a wonderful time of year, but also a busy one for gardeners. if you’ve worked hard at getting your outside space looking good,  make sure you take time out to enjoy it!\r\n"},
{"nid":"146","title":"Euphorbias and the joys of Spring","type":"blog","created":"1493593200","body_value":"If you travel round the ring road towards QMC and take the slip round that takes you down to the Dunkirk roundabout, on the island straight in front of you, you will see a large, striking group of Euphorbia characias wulfenii. Or, to use its common name, a spurge! Euphorbia is big family, large and small, shrubby and deciduous. They can add fabulous acid green contrast as well as structure to the clear bright reds and yellows and glorious chaos of the spring garden.\r\nThey are not always that huge. E. ’Fens Ruby’ is tiny but still makes its presence felt with its pretty bright, deep red leaves . It can be a bit invasive once it gets established, but it is easily dug up. Be careful though when handling as all Euphorbias exude a milky sap when wounded which can give you a nasty rash.\r\nThe most common and one of the easiest to grow is E. amygdaloides robbiae. It is our native wood spurge and looks lovely here at Charnwood in a woodland setting, setting off the spring bulbs, especially bluebells, beautifully. E. griffithii ‘Dixter’ has been awarded the Award of Garden Merit by the RHS. This is a herbaceous perennial with orange flowerheads in early summer. Euphorbias don’t need staking, they are mainly sturdy upright plants, always a Good Thing in my humble opinion.\r\nOne of my favourite Euphorbias as it gently seeds around and is a lovely mixer is E. dulcis ‘Chameleon’. It grows to about 40 cm tall with rich purple leaves. \r\nSome Euphorbias are quite strongly honey scented such as E. mellifera. This is a large, shrubby plant that needs a warm corner as it isn’t 100% hardy. It is a lovely thing and it will self-seed gently if you find the right spot for it. It really does have a lovely fragrance once established and flowering. We visited some friends in Whitby last month and they have a glorious specimen right by their front door, smelling fab.\r\nMy usual reminder this time of year – once your daffodils have done flowering,  deadhead them and give them a liquid feed if you have time. Don’t tie them up or cut them down, they need at least 6 weeks to feed through their leaves to ensure a good show next year. If they haven’t flowered very well now, it is a good time to dig them up and replant them with a bit more space and depth and with a handful of decent compost. If you bought any in pots for the windowsill you can plant them in the garden: I now have a big group of N. tete a tete at the front of a border created by that method!\r\nWe are going to the Malvern spring show this month. It is generally regarded as one of the best but we haven’t been before so I can’t speak from personal experience. You can get details and some previews of the gardens on the RHS website www.rhs.org.uk, the general RHS telephone number is 020 3176 5800. The show is from 11 to 14 May.\r\nI will give the last word this month to Monty Don: \r\n ‘It always seems to me that May is like that desiccated paper confetti that you drop into a glass of water and watch it grow out into a full, blossomy underwater bloom. Everything expands in May – light, day length, warmth and above all the sensation of being truly, richly alive.\r\n"},
{"nid":"147","title":"The Meadow Project at Charnwood","type":"blog","created":"1496271600","body_value":"Several years ago I wrote in this column about a new venture. We have an area under some elderly silver birch trees that was in need of a bit of TLC, a bit more interest. So we decided to try and establish it as a meadow.\r\n\r\nMany things were against us, the trees meant that there was a fair bit of shade so we would need to choose plants carefully and err on the side of woodlanders rather than out and out sunny meadow dwellers.  Also we didn’t want the work of taking off the grass already there, which is the best way of getting off to a good start. That meant any new plant had to compete not only with tree roots, but also with the well established, if a bit scruffy, firmly resident grasses. After we had begun the work, I went to a meadow gardening day course at Great Dixter with pal Liz, our favourite garden on the Sussex border near Rye. The lovely and brilliant head gardener, Fergus Garrett, went through the do’s and don’ts and ended up with the advice that a decent meadow took at least seven years to establish. That may have been useful to know at the start….\r\nWell, he was right, even a bit optimistic in our experience! One of the first things we did was to plant spring bulbs and the wonderful Matt Pyke did us proud, planting 250 of our little native daffodil, Narcissus pseudonarcissus, commonly called Lent Lilly, and some English bluebells in various spots to see where they thrived best. They both took about 3 or 4 years to get going but this spring they made their presence felt, looking gorgeously understated, pretty but natural. So that worked – phew! At the same time I did some research on what perennials would be good companions. I planted seed, and plugs, of various goodies including: a giant clover that I never saw again after the first year (probably rabbit food); that pretty little wild sweet pea or Vetch which is now growing well; the meadow cranesbill which is just about hanging in there; some sweet woodruff (gallium odoratum) that disappeared from where I planted it and emerged in an entirely different part of the garden but seems happy there; and some Ox Eye Daisies that I grew from seed and also took a while to spread around but are now doing so beautifully. Peter planted some fritillaries which make a fab show every April. Some uninvited but nonetheless very welcome guests have moved in and stayed now we don’t mow during the spring and summer months. These include buttercups, daisies, cow parsley, red campion and that delightful and graceful Lady’s Smock, sometimes called Cuckooflower. \r\nPeter will mow it all early Autumn, after the seeds have been set and spread around. As long as the grass is cut to make sure the spring bulbs can be seen and some of the more pernicious weeds are kept under control, that’s about it. I have planted a species rose, Rosa Glauca which looks perfect in the natural (if carefully contrived!) setting. We tried bamboo but that was the rabbits’ first course before the clover. I’m still trying new plans, and have just put in a few foxgloves to see how they thrive, fingers crossed. \r\n\r\nSo – a roaring success? No, but I still love it and, like pretty much the whole garden, am content that it is work in progress . We visited the Malvern Spring show last month which was wonderful. One of the many proud acquisitions we came home with was a plaque with this quote from Audrey Hepburn ‘To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow’. Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n"},
{"nid":"148","title":"Astrantias, Inulas and Penstemons","type":"blog","created":"1498863600","body_value":"Astrantias are my current favourite plant in the border at the moment. At Charnwood we have a deep red flowered plant next to a red leaved Berberis, the combination works really well. Astrantias self-sow gently, an attribute in my view. They don’t take up a lot of room, grow to a metre at most and gently in fill the gaps giving the border a natural look, their heads of tiny flowers are reminiscent of a pin cushion. One of the oldest and best loved varieties is A. ‘Shaggy’; it has white flowers with green tips. The colour range tends to be white through pink to deep wine red.  \r\n\r\nAnother favourite of mine, and an underrated one in my view, are the Inulas. This is a big family, most are beautiful big plants with large yellow daisies. There is one growing outside the study window now, in mid-June already standing at about 2 metres tall (pictured). So not a plant for the faint hearted, but a joy if you have the space. Once the flowers have finished the finches love the fluffy seeds. Inulas look good in a semi wild setting too, particularly in damp ditches where they thrive big time.\r\n\r\nAnd finally another beauty in the border is the Penstemon. Related to foxgloves, they are elegant, free flowering plants that reach their peak here in early July and keep on flowering until the frosts arrive. Their hardiness has been questioned, but I have found them to be pretty tough, although fairly short lived perennials. To be on the safe side take some cuttings, it is really easy and can be done any time from now onwards, they root readily. Penstemons come in a range of colours, blue, pink, red and a gorgeous deep red\/purple one called P. ‘Blackbird’.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of jobs to be getting on with this month, here are a few:\r\n•\tDeadheading: if you let plants flower and set seed, they will assume their job is done, stop flowering and put all their energy into making seed. So deadheading is the answer! Penstemons, sweet peas, cosmos, dahlias, roses and most other annuals and perennials will benefit from a regular dead head ;\r\n•\tCamellias need watering regularly now to ensure a good show next year. Give them a feed of sequestrated iron if your soil is on the alkaline side, or if the leaves are looking a bit sad and yellow;\r\n•\tIf your bearded iris didn’t produce many flowers, now is a good time to lift and divide to rejuvenate them. Pick out some small clumps with strong growing leaves and discard the woody middle of the plant. Make sure you replant them in a sunny spot with plenty of compost and grit for good drainage;\r\n•\tPlant autumn flowering Colchicum, sometimes called autumn crocus (despite the fact they are not crocuses!). Beautiful , striking flowers appear suddenly just when the garden needs a bit of a lift;\r\n•\tKeep an eye on recently planted trees and shrubs; if it is dry they will need a regular, generous watering at least for the first year.\r\n\r\nBut don’t work too hard; make sure you take the time to enjoy your summer garden!\r\n"},
{"nid":"149","title":"Time to make more plants for free - taking cuttings","type":"blog","created":"1502983572","body_value":"I’ve been taking some cuttings. It’s really satisfying to get more plants from you own garden for free and now is a good time to give it a go.\r\nMake sure you find a good healthy plant and try and find a non-flowering shoot if you can, but it’s not crucial, just nip the flower bud out. You need a cutting of around 6 inches or 15 centimetres if you’ve gone metric, cut just below a leaf then strip off most of the lower leaves and pop them into a pot of gritty, well drained compost.  If the soil is too heavy they may rot. \r\nYou can do this with a whole range of plants including geraniums (pelargoniums, a Regal pelargonium pictured), penstemons, rosemary, box,  salvia, species roses (not hybrid roses) and  lavender. If in doubt try it, you’ve little to lose. Keep them damp and out of bright sunlight and they should root in time for you to put them into individual pots in the autumn to overwinter somewhere sheltered. If they are tender plants such as geraniums and some salvias, they will need to be kept in a warm spot. \r\nAugust and September is a great time to visit gardens. The later summer flowers come into their own and the colour can be really vibrant. For a good show of dahlias, Anglesey Abbey, a National Trust garden just outside Cambridge has a wonderful display. Closer to home Felley Priory has some lovely herbaceous borders that should be looking good all summer. It has an excellent plant nursery and good cake too. But keep your eyes open: Peter and I had a wander around some beautifully kept allotments in Beeston last weekend. The neat rows of vegetables mingled in with dahlias, sweet peas , gently clucking fat hens and  yummy soft fruit were a joy to behold.\r\nI’m dithering over which bulbs to get this autumn. Now is the time to order them if you want a decent quantity and, as we have a big garden at Charnwood, I usually buy by them wholesale by the hundred. De Jager are our preferred supplier www.dejager.co.uk tel: 01622 840 229 but there are plenty of places to buy. We have a real problem with squirrels here, they love tulip bulbs and the most expensive the more they like to munch them. Tulips shouldn’t be planted til later in the year, unlike daffodils that benefit from an early autumn start. So around October I shall be soaking my new tulips in tonic water containing quinine before planting them good and deep.  Its bitter taste does put them off to some extent we find. Since I will be spending between 15 and 20 quid a time for 50 tulips, it’s worth the bother to keep the pesky creatures off them! With squirrels, rabbits, pigeons, slugs, snails, lily beetles, aphids, sawflies and the bloomin dog I sometimes wonder why I bother, there has even been talk of deer recently…\r\nEnjoy the rest of the summer, here’s hoping for some gentle night time rain for the garden and some gorgeous sunny days for us!\r\n"},

{"nid":"151","title":"Getting on trend with hydrangeas!","type":"blog","created":"1508404795","body_value":"Gardening, like most things it seems, is victim to fashion.  Some years ago, many gardeners wouldn’t dream of going near dahlias, now they are right back in fashion, especially the Bishop of Landaff, which has been glorious here at Charnwood this year and is still going strong as I write in mid September. If I remember to dead head it and give it a little feed and plenty of water, it will carry on until the first frost.\r\nHydrangeas are one of those shrubs now back in fashion. They were all over the big garden shows this year including Chelsea and some, such as Hydrangea ‘Limelight’ now has the prestigious Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society.\r\nThey look lovely in a woodland setting and, as this is predominantly a woodland garden, we went for the gentler, looser flowering type rather than the gloriously blousy, lipstick pink, mop head varieties you so often see adorning sea side gardens. \r\nOne we’ve tried before and failed with but are having another go with is Hydrangea Quercifolia meaning ‘with leaves like an oak’; the Latin name for Oak is Quercus. The leaves are, as the name suggests, just like a big oak leaf, which go a glorious colour in autumn. It is a real feature of this lovely shrub as well as the lovely white flowers in summer. The second is H.paniculata ‘Phantom’. It, too, has gorgeous flowers, starting out greenish and fading to white. \r\nWe planted them with a few handfuls of mycorrhizal fungi to give the roots a good chance of getting going as the soil here is heavy clay, a bit unforgiving for a new plant. Then we watered them really well and will continue to do so right into next year.  Peter has erected a little wire protective fence around them both to keep the bloomin’ rabbits from chewing them. Finally, a decent mulch of our fabulous garden compost and we have done all we can for now to give them a good home.\r\nLate July Peter and I visited Kew gardens, for both a general wander and more specifically to take a look at the Great Broad Walk Borders. Two new herbaceous borders, 320 metres long, were created around 2 years ago. A lengthy design process began in 2013 and generous private funders supplied the dosh. Planting started in 2015 when, on 6 October, eight topiary yew trees arrived and instantly gave the design formality and structure. 30,000 plants then followed, in batches of around 1500 and, thankfully, during a mild autumn so perfect for planting.\r\nIt is early days; herbaceous plants take a while to get their roots into the soil and looking and feeling at home. But in July 2017 the results are already looking wonderful so next year they should be even better.  During the same trip we went and had a stroll through the planting around the Olympic Park in London. Again, some gorgeous planting, mainly prairie style, with huge drifts of grasses and tall perennials (see photo).\r\nLots of inspiration to keep us working on and enjoying our garden!\r\n"},
{"nid":"152","title":"Monets garden","type":"blog","created":"1510512851","body_value":"Peter and I had a lovely week in France in September, gently pootling along the Seine. The highlight for me was a visit to Monet’s garden at Giverny.\r\nWe went to this glorious garden many years ago in May, when the wisteria covered bridge over Monet’s favourite waterlilies was in its full glory; so iconic and subject of so many paintings and photos. That was definitely worth seeing, but in Autumn the whole garden in my view was even more beautiful and spectacular with its late summer blousiness. \r\nWe learned a fair bit more about the garden’s regeneration and opening too – it wasn’t opened to the public until the 1980s. A retired head gardener, who had worked with Monet to create the original gardens, had kept all his original notebooks with planting plans so they could recreate his vision with some accuracy. Of course Monet was planting his garden to paint it, not for visitors. Specifically he wanted it to be there for him to paint the way the light played onto the plants at different times of day and in different seasons, hence the many paintings of what looks like the same thing, over and over. He loved clear, bright colours and exuberant planting; the garden at Giverny delivers big time on that!\r\nThe sheer number and profusion of flowers is wonderful and we felt totally enveloped. The garden is not full of rare plants but well known, tried and tested plants that are well grown and set out in huge numbers. Dahlias, salvias, tobacco plants, tall bright orange marigolds, golden rod and sunflowers all jostle together in a riot of colour. The waterlily garden, by contrast is a wonderfully calm, serene space with mature trees underplanted with shrubs and perennials. Doing a bit of research afterwards, I learned that the water lilies Monet was so obsessed with painting are grown in specially designed baskets. That way they can be lifted out at the end of the season and carefully pruned to keep them in separate groups, making them much better for painting.\r\nThe care and work that goes into the garden was very evident too. All along one path were neatly planted irises, all in groups of 10, leaves cut down neatly to about 10 cm and all carefully positioned so their tubers catch the most sun, key to getting good flowers. \r\nCreating that kind of atmosphere in a garden is not easy, but the visit confirmed for me that I’m not into neat gardens full of pastel colours, evergreens and manicured lawns.  But that is the joy of gardening, we all like different things from our own patch and, like other areas of life, diversity is a great thing!\r\nIt’s not too late to plant tulips. We soak them in tonic water with quinine in for an hour or so before planting to try to prevent the squirrels from eating them: it works to some extent. You can get some really good bargains now; just make sure the bulbs are nice and plump. If they are dried out they may not come good for you. If, like us, you have heavy clay soil, dig in a generous amount of grit when planting: bulbs all like well- drained soil to thrive and increase. Or plant them in a pot where you can give them the conditions they enjoy more easily.\r\nIt will be ideas for Christmas presents next – where does the time go?!\r\n"},
{"nid":"153","title":"Virburnum and seasons greetings!","type":"blog","created":"1514121461","body_value":"We have a Viburnum x bodnatense ‘Dawn’ by the front of the house. Most of the year it is a quiet, unshowy presence , but right now it is just lovely. The gorgeous scent (to me of almond, but your nose may smell something different!) is wonderful, and lifts our sprits in the dark days of Winter, flowering for many weeks.\r\nThis hardy, deciduous shrub began flowering in October this year. We brought it from our garden on the Isle of Wight in 1987 and it is still going strong. The white flushed with pink flowers fade slowly to pure white before giving way to small, rounded, purple berries in summer. By autumn, the green foliage transforms to a vibrant orange and yellow, in one final display before the winter returns. Our shrub is around 3 metres tall and getting rather congested, so, once it has finished flowering in late spring, I will be out there with my pruning saw, taking out about one third of the oldest stems right down to the ground. That way the shrub is completely renewed over 3 years and there is no temptation to trim off the top and turn it into a horrid lollipop of dead stems with a few weedy flowers at the top! I will give it a good, thick mulch of decent compost and, with luck, it will continue to give us pleasure for many more years to come.\r\nViburnum are worth having in the garden for their scent alone. We have a gorgeously smelly specimen - I’m not sure whether it is V.  x Juddii or V. Carelsii, but it has white tinged with pink flowers  with a wonderful fragrance. In April it fills the whole garden here at Charnwood.  We have it underplanted with snowdrops and white daffodils. It is in the part of the garden we rather pretentiously call our white garden. It starts with a white Cherry underplanted with a white shrub rose and a Exochorda x macrantha ‘The Bride’ (pictured). Then there are two mature weeping pear trees, white hardy cyclamen (pictured),  lily of the valley, white daffodil ‘Thalia’ and Solomon’s Seal. The odd yellow daffodil pops up here and there but the overall effect throughout  Spring makes us very happy! Talking of Lily of the Valley, I read in a gardening magazine that you can dig up a root now, pop it into a pot in a warm, light spot and it will flower within 4 weeks. It struck me that might make a good little Christmas gift, but I am getting ahead of myself, I will see if it works first!\r\nAs winter is here, it is a good time to get on with pruning, especially fruit trees.  So a decent pair of secateurs or a pruning saw would make an excellent Christmas present. I’m a compost anorak, and am hoping for some mushroom compost for Christmas. It keeps the weeds down, holds in the moisture, and feeds the soil as well as improving its structure, essential on our heavy clay. But I realise that isn’t a normal present request and is a bit difficult to wrap up and leave under the tree, so here are a couple more suggestions. A little cyclamen – they are lovely gifts and can be planted out in the garden in spring. You can’t do that with their bigger cousins, they are tender and will die if planted outside in the winter. Pots filled with bulbs are always welcome here for the same reason; you can enjoy them indoors and then plant them out; I have a whole border filled with tete a tete daffodils via that route! Just remember where you planted them and deadhead them when they have finished flowering and they will come up every year.\r\n"},
{"nid":"154","title":"Prune your buddleia davidii","type":"blog","created":"1519490978","body_value":"Februrary is often the month we are encouraged to prune our buddleias. I’m sure it could be done in March without a judicial enquiry, but gardening jobs are sometimes driven by custom than any real research into what is best. But for now, I suggest you go to it with a decent set of secateurs and maybe a pruning saw on the basis that it has always worked for me!.\r\nThere are different types of Buddleja, I’m talking here about B. davidii, with long racemes of usually purple flowers, smelling gently of honey, often seen colonising  waste ground. If yours has got huge and a bit of a mess, a really hard prune should be beneficial.  We cut our well established specimens down to about knee high just above a bud, but you can be more brutal. This will rejuvenate your plant, unless it is suffering badly from old age and neglect in which case it may pop its clogs. If that is a risk, you can always take cuttings, they root readily. We have a gorgeous pink buddleia (pictured)  bought as a gift from a kind gardening pal. She stood watching the various plants in the garden centre and picked the one that had the most visiting butterflies; what a fabulous way to choose! It continues to be beloved by now several generations of butterflies and bees as well as us. \r\nThe red leaved Cotinus is also about to get the hard prune treatment. It has got a bit big and is doing a plant version of a rather tall and gangly teenager. So that will be cut really hard back, practically coppiced. That way we should end up with a more compact, but graceful shrub with bigger and more dramatic leaves. My usual plea – please don’t do the lightly trim thing and turn every tree and shrub your garden into tidy-but-graceless lollipops! \r\nNow is a good time to divide ornamental grasses. They don’t like being moved until they are starting into growth.  I tried it one autumn and it sulked for a year or so then died. My favourite grass is Miscanthus ‘silver stripe’. It grows about a metre tall, has bright Autumn colour and a lovely elegant presence.\r\nI can’t write this column in February without mentioning snowdrops (Galanthus). There are 19 species of snowdrop and hundreds of different ones. You can, if you buy and plan well, have snowdrops in flower from September to April. We have a much cherished clump of the bigger G. ‘Sam Arnott’ by the front door, but named varieties can be ruinously expensive and for maximum impact I really do love the common G. nivalis. Its looks fabulous in big sheets under trees. When time and energy allow, we have gradually been lifting and dividing clumps after flowering  to make a bigger show. By doing it then you can see where you are planting and don’t stick them on top of existing bulbs! \r\nThere are several snowdrop gardens in reasonable reach of us to visit. The show at Hodsock Priory is especially wonderful. It’s a bit of a trek to Blyth I know, but well worth it. They are open for much of February, ring 01909 591 204 to make sure before you set off! Other spring bulbs such as aconites are also planted generously among the snowdrops.\r\nSpring is on the way so keep smiling and enjoy your garden as it emerges from its winter snooze!\r\n"},
{"nid":"155","title":"Pruning - cruel to be kind","type":"blog","created":"1520109690","body_value":"If you have passed by our house recently you may have seen there is a big gap at the front where a whole load of trees and shrubs once grew. Yes, we have had the heavy mob in to sort the tangly thicket that was once a beautiful collection of flowering trees. But do not despair on our behalf – there is method in our gardening madness.\r\nWe have, in effect, been cruel to be kind. The orange blossom, lilacs, shrub roses and viburnum were becoming really tired and congested. By pruning them really hard back they will, with reasonable weather and  a little luck, be rejuvenated and back to their prime; maybe not this year, but within one or two seasons . Once we have finished digging out the ivy that has smothered their roots (with the sterling work of Sam and Will) we will give them a nice dinner: a spade or two of decent compost.  \r\nIf I was better organised and had more time I would prune more regularly, pruning back about one third of each shrub down to the ground every year to make, in effect,  a brand new bush every three years. Be warned though, don’t do this now to your Spring or Summer flowering shrubs, you will cut off all the nascent flower buds. Save it until they have finished flowering. At the front we have sacrificed flowers this year for the longer term vigour of the plants – let us hope the deferred gratification is worth the wait!\r\nThe red lily beetle has been a real pest here in recent years. I have tried a daily check over my cherished lilies, but I never seem to get completely on top of them. Now is the time to try, though. They are unmistakeable bright red creatures, so pick them off pdq or your lilies will be done for. We have a lovely, decent sized patch or snakeshead fritillaries (photo) by the pond and I am told they enjoy munching their way through those as well. The beetles haven’t found them yet, but serious war will be waged if they do. Their larvae nestle underneath the lily leaves, doing an excellent impression of bird poo. Don’t be fooled, get your rubber gloves on (it really is yucky stuff) and go on the attack. \r\nTalking of garden visitors, I came across some research about wood lice. Did you know that they are not insects, but crustaceans, making them more like a prawn than a beetle? They do real good in your compost heap, helping to get it all nice and crumbly. So these little creatures are more friend than foe. Talking now of compost, now is a good time to get mulching. The soil is damp and still reasonably bare so you won’t smother plants. Peter has treated me to 20 bags of farmyard manure. It is gorgeous stuff, I will while away many happy hours spreading it around the garden to improve soil fertility and structure.\r\nWe have booked our trip to the Malvern Spring show again. We went for the first time last year and wondered why we had left it so long before visiting. It doesn’t have the sophistication of Chelsea, or the range of activities or celebrity as Gardeners World Live at Birmingham, but the plants on display for sale are beautifully grown and are all in their fresh, spring splendour. The setting is gorgeous too surrounded by the Malvern Hills. The show is from 10 to 13 May, tickets available  from RHSshowscustomercare@seetickets.com or ring 0844 995 9664.\r\n"},
{"nid":"156","title":"Natural - but contrived!","type":"blog","created":"1522537200","body_value":"We’ve a long-ish south-ish facing border at the back of our house that gets the sun for most of the day. The soil here at Charnwood, like most of this area in Nottinghamshire seems to be, is heavy clay, so we ladle mulch and\/or grit on as often as we have the time, energy and dosh to do so. This border is long established and has been well loved over the years, so the soil is decent and reasonably free draining. This makes it able to provides a good home for sun lovers such as iris, spring bulbs, salvias, lavender, sedums and those lovely, felty and grey lambs ears that we use for edging the paths. We keep the planting fairly low and gentle as the house wall is behind it and, when the wind whips in from the south west, it hits the back wall and charges full speed back into anything too tall or dense and flattens it. \r\nI love a natural looking border (even though the look is contrived) so self seeders are a firm favourite. Welsh poppies follow forget me nots, then come love in a mist and foxgloves. Aquilegias, or granny’s bonnets, dot themselves around, looking really pretty in the gaps among the perennials. \r\nLast Autumn I treated myself to a decent quantity of bare rooted aquilegias, soft reds and purples, and I will be planting them out in this border early this month. They were put in little pots and well watered to get them going on arrival and have overwintered in a sheltered spot; I think most have survived the chilly winter, fingers crossed. I have been fascinated by many plants since I was a little girl, and the story of Granny’s bonnets is lovely. The other name for them is columbine and they take their names from the Latin for two very different birds – eagles  (Aquilegia) and doves (Columba). The flower heads are supposed to look like birds with outspread wings and arching necks; I think I like Granny’s bonnets as a description best but take your pick! At the Malvern Spring show last year one of the stars was a fabulous bright orange aquilegia with red and yellow flashes. Aquilegias are not normally a showy ‘look at me’ presence  in the  border:  more of a gentle but pretty understudy. However this one shines out big time. I only hope it gets through to spring this year without the dog weeing on it, or someone’s boots accidentally squashing it. Oh the trial and tribulations of an obsessive plantswoman!\r\nVegetable gardening is neither mine nor Peter’s forte, but we are planning to have a go this Spring. I will be sowing some tomato seeds this month, most good gardeners would say it’s too late, but I find if they are started too early, they get leggy and never really do well. My favourite is ‘Sungold’, a cherry tomato with the best flavour, perfect for pasta sauce or in salads. Some Pink Fir Apple potatoes are chitting on the windowsill, described as ‘long, knobbly pink tubers with a creamy, waxy frim textured light yellow flesh’. They taste good too. \r\nSometime this month overwintered dahlias go into pots to wake them up and get them moving a bit. I find if they go into the border as decent plants growing on well they flower earlier and are less likely to be got at by slugs and snails who tend to enjoy the newly emerging, tender young shoots best. The tubers get a good going over first; any mushy old tubers are cut off. Give them a decent water and leaves soon appear. A kind pal gave me a gorgeous pink cactus flowered dahlia last year, I can’t wait to see it do its thing again this summer!\r\n"},
{"nid":"157","title":"Memorable garden visits","type":"blog","created":"1526846389","body_value":"Last month we ventured down south to visit Sissinghurst and Great Dixter, two inspirational but very different gardens. Sissinghurst is beautifully designed and planted, no weeds, very neat. The spring walk, flanked by pleached limes is wonderful at this time of year. Daffodils, grape hyacinths, a few crocus hanging on, early tulips, primroses, all looked so pretty. In the nuttery, woodlanders prevail including those rather curious trilliums that seem to me to have a slightly sinister quality but I know they have their admirers! A lovely splash of colour was provided by a generous group of tulips ‘Orange Emperor’: one to look up in the bulb catalogue this Autumn.\r\nGreat Dixter by contrast is messy and not weed free but if you are obsessive about plants like me, you will notice that again the planting is superb.  It is designed to create an overall effect of complete submersion by Summer. The large, rolling meadow (pictured) behind the gorgeous house, part designed by Lutyens , looked fabulous. Several different kinds of daffodil are gently planted in small groups so the ratio between the bright green meadow grass and the pale yellow and creamy white flowers looks perfect. One planting combination I am keen to copy is golden bamboo underplanted with blue Chionodoxa (or may have been Scillas, either would do the job), the bright blue stars next to the shiny gold stems looked fabulous together. Dead easy too, plant and let them get on with it!\r\nThere was also a plant fair going on that weekend at Dixter so, needless to say, we came home with a few treasures. Peter looked very quizzical when I appeared with three small bits of stick for £2. When I explained they were willow and would produce wonderful catkins he remained unconvinced. Clearly when we have a fab display of fluffy pussy willow he will soon he realise what a wise and very modest investment it was.\r\nWhen you go to a good plant fair, where really sound, detailed advice is on tap from skilled nursery women and men, you can appreciate their real understanding and passions for plants. Carol Klein must be one of the best living plantswoman around today and, at 72, is still going strong. Surely a testament to the health benefits of gardening. These wise words appear in her book ‘Carol Klein’s Favourite Plants’: ‘The only way to get to know a plant really well is through growing it’. So I was delighted to hear that Carol has recently been awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour.\r\nEstablished in 1897, the Victoria Medal of Honour (VMH) is awarded to British horticulturists by the RHS and is awarded for life. Only 63 medals may be held at any one time, in recognition of the duration in years of Queen Victoria’s reign.  So a massive honour, but so well deserved. The first 63 medals were awarded in 1897; I could only find two women among that list, Gertrude Jekyll and Ellen Willmott. Miss Willmott, it is told, used to sprinkle sea holly seeds in people’s gardens when they weren’t looking, hence the common name ‘Miss Willmott’s Ghost’.  More recent recipients of the VMH were Percy Thrower in 1977 and Jekka McVicar in 2017.\r\nMay is such a wonderful month in the garden, please make sure you take some time out to enjoy it!\r\n"},
{"nid":"158","title":"Make space for annuals","type":"blog","created":"1527807600","body_value":"Summer is here and the garden needs a bit of a tidy. Once the forget me nots, poppies and other spring flowers are over, I try and have a bit of a clear out to make space for some colour later on. Cosmos seems to be the go-to plant at the moment; it is certainly a class plant that fills those gaps beautifully. The main problem I find with them is that slugs and snails love them, especially when young. The best defence is to plant them as fairly well established plants,  the younger and tenderer the leaves, the more slugs will happily munch them down to the ground. Cosmos come in a wide range of colours and sizes including pinks, purples, white, orange and red. They have pretty fern like foliage that makes the border look really graceful, and flowering goes on for a long time if you dead head them regularly. \r\nI have managed to get some cleomes to germinate this year. These are also tall, classy plants, usually in the pink\/purple\/white range of colours; highly recommended if you want something a bit different.. Averaging around a metre in height, cleomes provide a focal point and (hooray) they don’t need staking.  Bees seem to love them too. Cleome flowers are really pretty; the petals radiate from a central point, forming an umbel, or cluster and the long stamens give flowers a spiky look, hence their common name ‘spider flower’.\r\nFoxgloves are going over now and are setting seed. Left undisturbed they will germinate in a few weeks. If you thin the seedlings out to give them some space, they will grow a rosette of leaves and flower most likely next year. That is why they are referred to as biennial plants.  If you want white foxgloves only, you can tell from the seedlings they are going to be white by looking at the central veins that are pale without any hint of purple so you can weed the rest out.  If you don’t have foxgloves in your garden and want some, now is the time to sow for a show next June. You can buy all kinds of different foxgloves, my favourite are the excelsior hybrids, like foxgloves on steroids! Other biennials you can get going now are forget me nots, wallflowers and sweet williams. An unusual and very dramatic biennial is the scotch thistle, or Onopordum. It grows to around 3 metres in a sunny well drained spot, has amazing jagged silver grey leaves and purple flowers like a giant thistle. Not to everyone’s taste I know (Peter hates them!) but I love them for their shouty ‘look at me’ presence. \r\nOne task to do as often as you are able is to deadhead, and not just cosmos. Roses, most bedding plants, penstemons, salvias, in fact most perennial and annual flowers will carry on producing new blooms if you cut off their heads once finished. If they set seed they think their job is done and stop producing flowers. A little regular feed helps as well: like you and me, if they are often hungry they won’t be at their best. Plant food can be given in all kinds of ways. A liquid feed of Phostrogen is my preferred method for plants in pots, but if you venture into a garden centre you will find endless products. One method I’m going to try this year is comfrey feed. We have loads of comfrey here, so it is a cost free option. Just cram a bucket with comfrey leaves, cover in water and leave it to stew for a couple of weeks. Get a lid as it smells like a teenager’s bedroom\/rotting cabbage\/unclean dustbin! Then put a cupful of the liquid in a fairly large watering can and water well. I have a mate who swears by it for producing a great crop of tomatoes, but I haven’t tried that myself, perhaps I will this year!\r\n"},
{"nid":"159","title":"Malvern and wisteria","type":"blog","created":"1532170869","body_value":"We visited the Malvern  Spring Festival again last month.  I know Chelsea is seen as the best of the best  for good reason, but we now much prefer the space, freshness and lack of celebrity of Malvern.\r\n\r\nTwo of the show gardens appealed – Billy’s Cave with the little goats was really different – a quote from the blurb:\r\n\r\n‘The garden is designed to evoke a slow pace smallholding in rural Portugal, where a goat herder spotted an opportunity within the boundaries of his land. A cave, complete with natural spring alongside an old olive tree has become part of the area’s character’. \r\n\r\nThe other, my favourite, was the Dew Pond.  In the words of the designer:\r\n\r\n‘… this garden makes a small step change to counter the effects of global warming…. Dew ponds are rooted in our agricultural heritage and provide a rich habitat for wildlife that can be enjoyed relaxing on the deck…’\r\n\r\nIt had a lovely, natural feel : my kind of garden. As part of the naturalistic planting there was a huge swathe of Ragged Robin. Feeling inspired I bought 3 plants for our little damp meadow. The label states: ‘Lychnis ‘Ragged Robin’ hardy perennial. Easy to grow, long flowered gorgeous’. So my kind of plant too! They make me smile every time I pass them to the front gate. Lychnis is a huge family and I bet most of you have at least one in your garden. \r\n\r\nLychnis coronaria has felty grey leaves and vivid pink flowers, it loves it here in a sunny border. One of it’s coloquial names is ‘Bridget in her bravery’, I wonder who Bridget was and what she did that was so fearless?  Lychnis chalcedonia has the coveted AGM, it’s common name is Maltese Cross. This lovely, easy plant has bright red flowers.  As a family they tend to be short lived, but gently seed around so you are never without them.\r\n\r\nThe wisteria has been fabulous this year. We have 3 in the garden here at Charnwood, including a gorgeous pale lilac one that Peter has trained into a small tree, around 1.5 metres tall so takes up very little room. They are very vigorous, woody climbers so need a fairly brutal pruning regime if you don’t have unlimited space and\/or a massive tree to grow one into.  Once you have established a framework that suits you, prune hard back to 2 or 3 buds around February then give it a feed:  sulphate of potash is good to encourage flowers to form. You can then do a summer prune to keep it under control.   Often overlooked is the scent, when in full flower the fragrance is just lovely. If you are planning to buy one, make sure it has been grafted.  It will cost you a lot more but if you get a cheaper seedling it can take over 20 years to flower.\r\n\r\nDon’t forget the Tollerton Garden Club plant stall at the Village event, I have bought some lovely, well grown plants from there over the years, definitely worth a look!\r\n"},
{"nid":"160","title":"Hidcote ","type":"blog","created":"1533141410","body_value":"Garden visiting I find is great for getting new ideas. We had a lovely weekend away last month in the Cotswolds and called by Hidcote Manor Gardens on the way. Lawrence Johnston bought Hidcote in 1907 and turned it into a beautiful garden with the support of his mother. Now it is owned by the National Trust. From the website:\r\n‘Today income generated by approximately 175,000 people who visit Hidcote every year ensures the garden is maintained to a high standard, and that the beauty that Lawrence Johnston created between 1907 and 1948 will be preserved for future generations to enjoy’\r\nIn July the roses were gorgeous. By then the hot weather was beginning to dry our gardens up big time, so I was interested to see a ‘gardeners note’ explaining that they had thoroughly watered, and then mulched all the roses at the onset of the heatwave. All the evidence I’ve seen suggests that a really good soak less often is better for the plants and more environmentally responsible. Although if you have pots, they will need a regular water. We’ve put most of our pots in a group all together to make watering easier, they look good altogether too.\r\nA highlight for me at Hidcote was several large, informal borders with generous swathes of tall ferns interspersed with white Astrantia – it really did look magical on a big scale (see photo). I’m going to have a go at recreating the look here if I can get hold of a decent quantity of Astrantia in the autumn, I may have a go at growing some from seed.\r\nThe hot, dry weather persists as I write in mid-July and there seems no prospect of rain. Plants that don’t seem to mind the conditions here at Charnwood are Sea Holly (Eryngiums), the Mediterranean herbs such as Rosemary  and Thyme, as well as Sedum and Stachys byzantina, often covered in bees and butterflies. Lavender ‘Hidcote’ has been a star here as well, loving the sun. The ornamental grasses seem fine too.  Best of all is my proud new addition, Paulownia tomentosa or the foxglove tree that has grown about two metres more in the last 2 months and now stands at around 4 metres tall. No flowers yet – I live in hope! \r\nThe autumn bulb catalogues came through the letterbox on June this year. I saw a really pretty daffodil at the Malvern Show, N. ‘Moonlight Sensation’ so have ordered some for pots next year. It is a graceful triandrus narcissus meaning there is more than one flower per stem. I prefer the smaller, paler flowers to the big yellow trumpet varieties but each to their own. Daffodils prefer to be planted early in the new season; late August is not too soon. Tulips are better planted later, October at the earliest, or they end up failing. I’ve planted tulips I’ve found at the back of the shed in January and they have flowered, a bit later than usual, but no complaints about that.\r\nI hope by the time you are reading this we have had some rain.  Preferably when we are in bed, gentle rain that continues all night, and every night time for about 2 weeks to refresh our poor baked gardens.  But now I’m off to do some blooming watering again; oh the trials and tribulations of a plant obsessed gardener!\r\n"},
{"nid":"161","title":"This hot summer","type":"blog","created":"1538348400","body_value":"The hot summer has really sorted the sun lovers from the rest in the garden this year. Our Indian Bean Tree (Catalpa) has been glorious and actually now has beans:  they followed on from the masses of elegant, loose racemes of white flowers.  We have had sunflowers the size of dinner plates and now in early autumn, Dahlias, Rudbeckias, Verbena bonariensis, tobacco plants, Cleomes and gorgeous red Alstroemeria (pictured) are making a gorgeous show. I’ve not done a scientific study but experience has made me think that the secret to survival is to follow the ‘right plant, right place’ mantra. Where the garden has looked less good is where I have taken a risk and, for example, planted something in a spot on the dry side when it needs a shadier, cooler position. Well looked after beds also did better here – there is nothing like a decent, regular and generous application of good garden compost to keep the soil, and therefore things living and growing in it, happy and well.\r\nNot thriving so well are our new acquisitions of hydrangeas and we have been lugging cans of water to them for a big chunk of the summer. Fingers crossed they survive.\r\nI had a better go at growing some vegetables this year. Runner beans, chillies and tomatoes have been delicious. We have nearly drowned in courgettes. This from Christopher Lloyd’s excellent book ‘Gardener Cook’ rang true:\r\n‘There are courgettes of course, but unless you gather them daily they enlarge into the marrows they really are. I don’t like being hounded by my vegetables …..  Sometimes it’s nice not to have to think about them daily. Life is already complicated with dogs and cats, not to mention humans’.\r\nIn order to use them up I had a look for courgette rich recipes on the net. One has been a real success and is really quick and easy:  400g of courgettes and a 225g pack of haloumi, both grated.; it’s a bit messy but don’t worry, it will hold together well  enough.  Add 200g of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, a pinch of dried oregano and the zest of a lemon. Mix all the ingredients together and form them into patties. Fry gently in olive oil, a few minutes each side. I popped them in the oven then for about 20 minutes to make sure they are cooked through and crispy. Makes about 16.\r\nBulbs I ordered in July have been arriving – much excitement ensues (well from me at least, Peter prefers the almost daily delivery of the latest gadget from the internet:  each to their own I guess). I bought gorgeous white triandrus (multi headed) daffodils ‘ Moonlight Sensation’ and bright red tulips ‘Havran’ from Peter Nyssen www.peternyssen.com 0161 747 4000. There are more to follow; as you may have gathered I absolutely love spring bulbs. The daffodils are already in the ground - the sooner they are in the better. Tulips are best left until the end of this month or they may not thrive. I will do my usual trick of soaking them in tonic water containing quinine to try to stop the squirrels from munching them all – it does work to a reasonable extent. The little critters always seem to head for the most-cherished-and-very-expensive tulips. \r\n"},
{"nid":"162","title":"Get dividing!","type":"blog","created":"1541877303","body_value":"I’ve been dividing my day lilies. Gosh, I hear you say – why, and why now? \r\nKeeping your herbaceous perennials healthy and looking good sometimes requires some work. This is a really good time of year to lift and divide plants that have got congested. That is when the middle of the plant looks bare and sad, and flowers  scarce.  Day lilies are especially prone to running out of steam, but if you dig them up now (as long as it’s a reasonably mild spell), add a bucket of decent compost to the soil and then plant some of the new, bright looking clumps you very likely will be rewarded with more flowers next year.\r\nPlants, like humans, vary in how they like to be looked after.  A general rule of thumb is that if they flower later on during late summer or in the autumn, they are best left  until spring. Michaelmas daisies usually do best when refreshed then. \r\nYou can be brutal: dig up the whole plant and cut chunks off with a spade. The common advice is to use two forks back to back to prise stems  apart but I can’t say I find that very easy. Make sure you have some good shoots at the top and roots at the bottom on each piece. Leave out the old and tired middle section. Water well and give them a mulch and away they will go.  After I did the job with my day lilies I planted some early flowering spring bulbs amongst them; they will have flowered and died by the time the lily leaves grow tall and cover the dying leaves. At least that’s the plan!\r\nOur pond has needed some tlc for a while. It had become less of a pond and more of a bog garden. So we have bitten the bullet and got a firm of pond specialists in to make it better. It was initially dug and planted over 20 years ago, so it feels like we got our moneys worth! As I write today their digger is stuck in the mud and I’ve just had to find some rope to help them  pull it out. But I’m staying calm (ish), I’m sure it will look fab next spring.\r\nThe received wisdom now seems to be that pond planting is contained, either by putting plants into gravel on a marginal shelf in the pond, or in a basket at the bottom for lovelies such as water lilies. Last time planting was straight into some soil at the bottom, but that is more difficult to keep under control. It’s a big pond, we are lucky and have the space so I’m looking for a decent sized, natural looking feature. Fingers crossed it blends beautifully into the landscape and our resident wildlife approves and moves back in.\r\nI’m not a fan of winter pansies, mainly because I think they have a misleading name. But I weakened a few weeks ago and bought some. I popped them in a trough by the front door and they do look good in the autumn sunshine. But I’m not expecting a brilliant show when winter really comes with a vengeance. I think they would be better named ‘autumn and spring flowering pansies when the weather is good’. Not such a snappy title to attract the punters I guess.  Moores have a lovely range of them, and also have violas, their daintier cousins. I popped a few in a pot with some dwarf daffodils, always a cheery combo. A pot full of spring bulbs and pansies make good Christmas presents so I’ve done a couple extra for pals.\r\nGet dividing those perennials, you will get a better workout than a visit to the gym!\r\n"},
{"nid":"163","title":"A very special visitor!","type":"blog","created":"1543622400","body_value":"We’ve had a very special garden visitor in recent weeks – a kingfisher.  Such beautiful, unmistakeable birds with a real wow factor. Inevitably I went to the internet to find out a bit more about them and found that they are territorial. The size of the territory depends on the amount of food available, and on the local bird population. Kingfisher territories tend to cover at least 1km of river, but may extend much wider. Small fish such as stickleback are their favourite food, but they will also nosh aquatic insects and tadpoles. The visit to us is fairly typical in the winter when they may have to go a bit further afield for a decent meal. Our newly refurbished pond is looking magnificent but will be a big disappointment to our wonderful visitor as we have decided against having fish in it, preferring a more wildlife friendly pond this time.\r\nWater in the garden is a must if you want the widest range of wildlife possible. It doesn’t have to be huge, we’ve a mate in Lady Bay with an old washing up bowl submerged as a liner, there are frogs in residence as well as marginal plants and looks just fine. \r\nAbout now I wonder why I haven’t planned for more winter colour in the garden, but we do have some stars to keep us going throughout the darker months. Multi stemmed dogwoods with both bright lime green and red stems add some structure. We will cut them back hard in March to keep the young, brightly coloured stems coming in time for next winter. Hollies in my view are a much underrated shrub; I was given a gift of Ilex ‘Golden King’ earlier this year and it is already brightening up a dull corner with its green and yellow variegated spikey leaves.  The Mahonia is looking fabulous as I write: it stands around 3 metres tall with many gorgeous spikes of yellow flowers, gently but beautifully scented. Two Daphnes grace the front garden: not actually that graceful a shrub to be honest but the perfume is stunning, it invades the whole garden early in the year with a heady scent. Hardy cyclamen are still looking good and have seeded around. You can buy the little pots in garden centres now, they make lovely, long lasting Christmas presents as they can be planted outside after you have enjoyed them in the house. Don’t plants the bigger cyclamen outside though; they are tender so won’t survive.\r\nOther ideas for the gardener in your family for Christmas: Peter bought me some Niwaki secateurs for Christmas last year. They are brilliant, really sharp, light and easy to use. I also have a Niwaki spade that is awesome, it cuts through the heaviest clay like a knife through butter. Now I’m old and so have rather less than agile knees, a decent, thick kneeling mat is a must. That, plus a good trowel and a decent sized trug and I can while away many happy hours planting and weeding. As long as I have regular and large mugs of tea that is!\r\nI’ll be back in February when the daffodils, crocus and snowdrops will be coming up and Spring will be round the corner. Very best wishes to you and yours for the festive season.\r\n"},

{"nid":"165","title":"Hellebores and pruning","type":"blog","created":"1549065600","body_value":"February is a good month for the start of a great season for what can broadly be described as woodland plants: think snowdrops, ferns, hellebores, hardy geraniums, epimediums and dicentra for starters.  So many lovely plants will thrive in gentle shade, especially if it is on the damp side. Dry shade is a bit trickier but not impossible.\r\nHelleborus niger is the Latin name for Christmas Rose, with gorgeous white flowers for many months from December and sometimes looking good right up until Easter. The 'sister' of the white Christmas Rose is the Lenten Rose (Helleborus orientalis), which comes in many shades, often pink or purple or a mixture (see photo). They can seed around, cross pollinating so you can end up with a right old of mix of shades, no bad thing in my view but you may want to pull up the muddier pinks. Once settled and happy,  Hellebores will improve with age, making big, generous clumps. It’s a good idea early in the year when you can see the new flower buds emerging, to cut off the old leaves as they tend to look tatty, and may get all blotchy and diseased. \r\nWhile browsing through a gardening magazine I found an advert for Ashwood Nurseies at Kingswinford near Stourbridge, a real obsessive plantswoman’s dream of a place with a wide range of woodland plants and shrubs including dwarf pines, hellebores and primulas. They have hellebore open days in February, so a trip is eagerly anticipated.  The website is www.ashwoodnurseries.com ; phone 01384 401 996. I’ll let you know how we get on.\r\nFollowing the excitement of our glamourous visitor to our shiny new pond before Christmas, namely the kingfisher, Peter has found a camera that can be sited outside and, when activated by movement, will film any garden ‘visitors’. It wasn’t very expensive and is easily strapped to a tree so dead easy to fit. If you want to join in that kind of fun, the firm is a social enterprise called Naturespy:  Shop.naturespy.org  or phone 01978 437 837. If I get a photo of a bloomin rabbit chewing our much prized new Acers or the Magnolia stellata there will be Big Trouble….\r\nWe’ve been steadily doing the winter tidy at Charnwood, clearing away the leaves for leafmould, cutting back dead perennials and generally trying to make sure the thousands of spring bulbs can see the light of day. It takes a while in an acre of garden, but unlike when the growing season is in full swing, there’s no real rush. It is good too to provide a few leaves and general messiniess for hibernating insects such as ladybirds and small mammals to have a winter snooze under. \r\nFebruary is a good month for pruning many things: apples, figs, wisteria, shrubs such as buddleia and  the multi stemmed dogwoods.  Don’t prune your spring flowering shrubs now though as you will chop off the tiny flower buds; a summer prune is usually best for them. I’m also going to sow some sweet peas before the end of the month. They like a long root run, so I sow 3 seeds to a long plant pot and pop them in a sheltered position away from mice and slugs. I’ve also gone a bit bonkers and bought a large quantity of those beautiful little yellow aconites ‘in the green’ to plant under our trees. Buying this way has a number of benefits, not least that you can see what they will look like straight away and you are unlikely to plant on top of other emerging bulbs. Snowdrops and other spring bulbs can be bought like this now and there are some good bargains online.\r\n"},
{"nid":"166","title":"To mulch or not to mulch?","type":"blog","created":"1552762224","body_value":"To mulch or not to mulch – that is the question at this time of year. Mulching your borders has real benefits especially if, like us at Charnwood, your soil is sticky, cold, heavy clay. It breaks it down, improving the structure so making it crumblier and easier to plant and sow into. The material you use will depend on what is available and what you can sensibly move around. It can be expensive too: the last big load we had delivered was well over £100. It was gorgeous stuff though; half farmyard manure and half mushroom compost. The plants loved it. \r\nHowever, your own garden compost is free! I’m a real compost anorak and we have 9 compost bins in the garden, not including several large wire containers for leaf mould. Last year was so dry that grass clippings, the main ingredient to keep the compost hot and so nicely breaking down, were in very short supply. The sad upshot is that we now have several empty bins. Garden compost is a great mulch, both feeding and improving soil structure, but if it doesn’t get really hot to kill them off, it can contain weed seeds that germinate readily once spread around in the Spring. So it pays to have your hoe at the ready!\r\n\r\nOther materials can be used if you want a weed suppressant. Bark chippings and coco shells are widely available in garden centres. Gravel looks good in a sunny, Mediterranean style setting and will make plants loving good drainage such as lavender, cistus, pinks and rosemary happy. It also fits well with the current Japanese garden fashion. In that vein we are having a go with some pebbles to create a kind of dry river bed in a sunny corner of Charnwood.  To achieve the right effect we have treated ourselves to some dwarf trees: Pinus strobus ‘Minima’ (pictured) and a fabulous looking dwarf Japanese Larch. Fingers crossed they thrive and the rabbits\/dog\/squirrels\/other random wildlife do not dig them up, wee on them or fancy a nibble.\r\n\r\nThe downside of mulching is that you can smother plants, including some of the nicer self seeders. This garden depends a lot on lovely plants such as poppies, foxgloves and verbena gently spreading their seed around to get a more natural looking, gentle effect that we love.  ‘Neat’ doesn’t enter into our gardening vocabulary. We agree with the late and lovely Derek Jarman’s view that ‘if a garden isn’t fluffy, forget it’!\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned pine and larch came from a recent visit to Ashwood Nursery in Kingswinford. It is in the West Midlands and took an hour and a half to get there but it is well worth it if, like us, you love your plants. The nursery owner’s garden was also open the day we went: it was truly inspirational, even in February. Not at all our style of garden described above, it has beautifully clipped and topiarised holly and yew, trees  including witch hazel and dogwoods and many shrubs rather than the softer herbaceous perennials , but beautiful nevertheless. If we all liked the same kind of garden the world would be a much less interesting place.  Of course the same applies to other things in life too, but that’s a whole different column!\r\n\r\n If you fancy a visit to Ashwood and want to see the garden as well, check when it’s open first on  01384 401 996 or the website www.ashwoodnurseries.com   Hellebores are their speciality, they had a whole, big greenhouse full of them. They also have lots of interesting miniature pines ; we were spoilt for choice. Heaven!  It has a good, if expensive café with delish cake too.\r\n\r\nAs I write in mid February the sun is shining and it is 10 degrees. I hope when you get to read this we are not knee deep in snow and ice, happy gardening!\r\n"},
{"nid":"167","title":"Daffodils and annual climbers","type":"blog","created":"1554073200","body_value":"It may be a bit late this year given the mild winter to talk about daffodils, but they are such a cheery, welcome sight when they arrive in spring. All you have to do is plant them early autumn the pointy side up about twice their depth and away they go for years and years. Having said that, some are better do-ers than others when it comes to increasing and flowering.\r\nThe best early ones here are February gold, closely followed by February silver. This year they DID appear in February, but in a ‘normal’ season (whatever that is!) they rarely emerge before March. Like all daffodils, I do try and deadhead them and give them a little feed once the flowers fade, but apart from that I let them get on with it. Tete a tete are usually the little chaps you see sold in pots everywhere. If you have succumbed, pop them into your garden once they are over and, like many spring bulbs such as hyacinths, snowdrops, fritillaries and crocus, they will come up again in subsequent springs. \r\nDon’t cut off the leaves, or tie them in knots, that will prevent their leaves from putting food back into the bulbs. Grit your teeth and be a bit untidy, the bulbs will thank you for it and reward you next year!\r\n‘Jenny’ are another favourite, flowering next, mid March this year. They are graceful and reliable with soft lemon middles and creamy outer, slightly outward curving petals. The native (some disagree I know) Lent Lily with the rather scary name of Narcissus pseudonarcissus are really lovely in a gentle, understated way, we have them under silver birches at Charnwood. Lent lilies take a few years to get going but now, after around 10 years, they are making their presence felt. Only standing at around 15 cm with soft yellow trumpets they will seed around and very slowly increase if you can give them the right conditions. For the best in elegance and style, ‘Hawera’ take some beating, and flower later, sometimes into early summer. They do tend to run out of steam here after a few years  but are dwarf and very dainty, so look especially lovely in pots. Last but not least to mention and flower,  ‘Thalia’,  a triandrus hybrid meaning several blooms to each stem. She is almost pure white and fabulous. You may have guessed that we like the paler and smaller daffodils, but there are varieties to suit everyones taste if you prefer something brighter and more muscular. We have had daffodils flowering here from December right through to May in some years, they are a huge and diverse group of bulbs.\r\nIf , like me, you were happy to see Monty Don return with Gardeners’ World in March, you may have seen a piece on annual climbers. This prompted me to get the books out and try something a bit more unusual. Of course sweet peas are a must and we already have the Chilean Glory Vine, Eccremocarpus scaber. This easy climber has ferny leaves and bright orange flowers (it also comes in pink and yellow shades), seeds around and climbs impressively in a very short time. It is easy to pull up if it gets too bossy and invasive and looks lovely scrambling through our variegated yuccas. And of course sweet peas are a must! So I’m revisiting an old friend I’d forgotten about, Rhodochiton astrosanguineus or the purple bell vine. It isn’t the easiest thing to get going from seed  in my experience, so I found some mini plants online. It is a more gentle climber, so needs a smaller host. A Japanese maple may be good?\r\n"},
{"nid":"168","title":"Good local plant nurseries","type":"blog","created":"1556665200","body_value":"Discovering a family run, independent nursery where you can buy well grown and cared for plants at a reasonable price is always a joy. So I was well chuffed to visit Ashdale Nursery on Lambley Lane in Gedling at the recommendation of a friend. If you are looking for a wide range of healthy perennials, bedding plants, a decent choice of tomato plants and NOT an all singing and dancing garden centre with nasty jumpers or naff garden furniture, then this is well worth a visit. The purchase of primulas was my main mission as we have just made ourselves a bog garden out of a small pond that was leaking. Primulas like the kind of soil that is often quoted but is almost impossible to create:  damp,  sunny, and well drained.  So an ex pond now has holes in the liner, been topped up with decent soil incorporating some compost and well watered.  Three beautiful P. japonica ‘Millers Crimson’ from Ashdale are now happily in residence, with some iris for a bit of height. As long as I can stop the dog burying his bone in the nicely cultivated soil, or a squirrel or rabbit doing some destructive excavation, I’m sorted.\r\n\r\nAshdale Nursery can be found at 204 Lambley Lane, NG4 4PB, ‘phone 0115 845 7864.  A friendly welcome and good advice awaits!\r\n\r\nMoores,  at Stanton on the Wolds, is also family run and often has a reasonable selection of plants too. There is nothing wildly unusual, but it’s very good for basic things such as herbs, dependable perennials including delphiniums and lupins,  a  wide range of value for money bedding plants and, from time to time, a really good offer. I found a lovely Magnolia ‘Leonard Messel’  in a bargain bay for a very reasonable price. He was looking a bit the worse for wear, but with a  little tlc and admittedly a mild spring, Mr Messel  is flowering and looking well as I write.  I have given him, as well as all my acid loving shrubs a good old watering with sequestrated iron this year. It’s a liquid feed, designed to help acid loving shrubs take up the nutrients they need in soil that is on the alkaline side. That includes acers, magnolias, skimmias, rhododendrons, azaleas, and camellias. If you have any of those in your garden and they look a bit unhappy with yellowish, sad leaves, they are going hungry. Try giving them a feed about once every couple of weeks over the summer months:  more often if it is dry. They will love you for it. You just add a cap or two of sequestrated iron to a watering can of preferably rainwater, but follow the instructions and all will be well! If you are unsure of your soil type, you can buy a cheap and easy to use test kit from any garden centre and some DiY stores. \r\n\r\nAt the end of May I usually cross my fingers and plant out some tender perennials in any gaps in the borders. This year I am nurturing a few Tithonia I managed to grow from seed, otherwise known as the Mexican sunflower. They are like little bright and zingy orange sunflowers, with tall, branching stems; they should flower all summer and until the first frost.  Assuming they survive to the end of the month, they will be planted in drifts with red ‘Bishop of Llandaff dahlias I’ve over wintered in the greenhouse,  bronze fennel (lovely little plants from Moores) and purple Verbena Bonariensis that seeds around freely here. I have a clear picture of how I want it to look – I will let you know if it all succeeds! \r\n\r\nMay is such a gorgeous month; make sure you take time to enjoy it. There is nothing like a glass or a cuppa in the garden on a warm evening in early summer evening after a hard day at work!\r\n"},
{"nid":"169","title":"Living lightly on our planet","type":"blog","created":"1559343600","body_value":"Huge concerns now abound about the effect we humans are having on our planet. It can feel a bit hopeless:  what on earth, quite literally, can we do as individuals to prevent the catastrophic events now predicted? So I did a bit of thinking, and research to see if there are some simple, inexpensive things we gardeners can do. Some of these suggestions also apply if you are not convinced by the arguments from scientists about climate change as they can save you time and money.\r\nConserve water. Water butts are cheap and fairly easy to install and it is surprising how much water comes off even a small shed or greenhouse. Rainwater is also better for plants such as orchids, and ericaceous plants such as azaleas, camellias, blueberries and acers as it is usually acidic. Mulching your borders after a few days’ rain prevents the soil from drying out so quickly and keeps the weeds down. If you make your own compost that helps reduce your carbon footprint too.\r\nReuse your plastic plant pots. At the moment you can’t recycle them, but they can be used again and again. I have several plant sales for charity over the spring and summer months and kind pals give me their pots so I very rarely buy any now. There are now taupe pots that have been specifically designed to be recycled easily, but I understand it is still hard to find a recycler; no doubt that will change soon.  You can use the inside of loo rolls as pots for seedlings: I did so for my sweet peas this year.  I have also been given a ‘paper potter’ to try. This is a gadget that enables you to make pots out of old newspapers.\r\nSupport and encourage biodiversity. Plant trees, shrubs, annuals and perennials that bees and other beneficial insects can feed on and so thrive. A small tree can provide a home for all kinds of creatures and if you plant a fruit tree you can enjoy the harvest too. Herbs are good; we have several rosemary bushes here at Charnwood, they were all covered in bees from early spring. Early spring flowers provide food for bees when there is little else around for them. Frogs and toads like a pile of damp logs to snooze under, so don’t be too tidy!\r\nIf you have any other suggestions please send them to me and I will gladly pass them on through this column.\r\nNow is a good time to sow seeds of biennial plants such as foxgloves, wallflowers and forget me nots. I sowed some foxgloves direct where I wanted them to flower some years ago and simply thinned them out in situ. They are now well established in the garden and seed around happily.\r\nDon’t forget the excellent Tollerton Gardening Club plant stall at the village event. I have many lovely plants in my garden, some really unusual, from there. \r\nJune is a lovely month to do some garden visiting, and  the National Garden Scheme ‘yellow book’ gardens are often well worth a visit. The closest ones I can find this month are at 125 Shelford Road in Radcliffe, open 23 June from 1.30 and Rose Cottage at 81 Nottingham Road in Keyworth on 30 June from 12. Both have teas and plants for sale: a pretty garden to mooch around, good home-grown plants to buy and tea and cake, plus it’s all for charity, what more could you want? More NGS gardens to visit can be found at www.ngs.org.uk  \r\n"},
{"nid":"170","title":"Salvias","type":"blog","created":"1561935600","body_value":"It wasn’t until recently I realised that I have a lot of Salvias in the garden here at Charnwood. I’d been unable to resist a gorgeous and rather fetchingly named (more on that later)  S. ‘Lavender Dilly Dilly’ at a local nursery. When I tried to find just the right spot for it I noticed that there were already two salvias in the bed I was eyeing up for a gap and I have more in sunny beds throughout the garden.\r\n\r\nSalvias are members of the sage family with over 1,000 different kinds.  You can usually identify them by the rather pungent smell of their leaves: the sage we use in cooking is usually Salvia officinalis. If you don’t use too much of it in your sage and onion stuffing and leave it to flower, it will produce lilacy\/purple flower spikes that are a magnet for bees. Sun, reasonable soil and good drainage provide their preferred home, and if given those conditions and then looked after a little bit, they will flower and flower throughout the summer. Salvias can be woody, herbaceous perennials (meaning they die right down in winter and then emerge again in Spring) or annuals.\r\n\r\nS. ‘Hot Lips’ is to be seen in almost any garden centre you may frequent. I tried it in a pot for the first couple of years but it failed to really thrive until I planted it into some decent soil in a sunny spot. It has now made a bush just over a metre tall and wide. I worried that it wouldn’t be winter hardy, being woody and a bit tender looking, but it easily survived the last, albeit mild, winter very well. I cut it back by about a third all over in early spring, which seems to have made for a better show. With a little imagination you can see why it has been given its name: it is lipstick red and white. It also ensures good sales I’m guessing!\r\n\r\nSadly it wasn’t the same story for that other regular offer at garden centres, Salvia ‘Amistad’. I bought one in Spring of last year, it cost me a fortune, looked absolutely fabulous all summer with its striking purple flowers and tall, elegant presence at the back of a border.  Then it did an impression of a dead thing all over the winter that turned out to be a permanent state despite being carefully sited in a sheltered spot. Luckily I had been warned this may happen and had taken some cuttings and over wintered them frost free. They grew on well and are now planted out and coming on a treat. So the gardening moral of that story is, as for many plants (and in life), take precautions!  \r\n\r\nS. Hot Lips and Amistad are the woody kind of Salvia, there are herbaceous versions that are reliably hardy. I love them so much because they often come in the deep, rich colours that zing out, and mix beautifully in borders. I had a lovely combo this year of a bright yellow Achillea, red and white S. ‘Hot Lips’ and a herbaceous salvia (name long forgotten) with deep purple spikes for weeks.  Not only did it look lovely, the bees, butterflies and hoverflies enjoyed it too.\r\n\r\nTalking of good names to aid commercial success, I treated us to some David Austin English shrub roses early this year. One beauty, ‘The Lark Ascending’ (how could anyone resist that?!) flowered for the first time last month. The colour is exquisite, apricot and soft yellow shades with a hint of pink. David Austin died earlier this year aged 92 after a lifetime of breeding top quality shrub roses. They are not cheap, around £18 for a bare root rose. But when you bear in mind the skilled, patient work and the years that go into producing such a beautiful plant, I’m not complaining. A rose like that is a long term investment; with some tlc and a fair wind it should, as my mother used to say ‘see me out’! Blessed also with a ‘buy me’ name is Madame Alfred Carriere, a beautifully perfumed white climbing rose. She adorns the back of the house, is really easy to please and, after one of Peter’s hard prunes in April was covered with blooms last month. He has fed and dead headed her to encourage more flowers into the Autumn.\r\n"},
{"nid":"171","title":"Baby Orlas!","type":"blog","created":"1564614000","body_value":"I am in awe of all you clever and resilient growers of vegetables. So much of my efforts to grow something good to eat turns into rabbit food, or just doesn’t thrive. So a recent go at growing new potatoes in a different way has cheered me up no end. In spring I bought 3 tubers of a seed potato ‘Orla’. A large tub was selected, cleaned up and Orla x 3 duly planted. I watered regularly and ‘earthed them up’, meaning topping up with soil as the green leaves emerged. And yesterday – hooray – we upturned the tub and were delighted to find a gorgeous pile of blemish free baby Orlas weighing in at almost 2 kilos. They are delicious too. Potatoes planted in our solid, sticky clay really don’t do well: they come out like mush and full of slugs. So now I know that’s the way to do it! The runner beans are well up the poles and in flower, tomatoes are looking reasonably good and yellow courgettes are taking over the plot. So I’m getting better! \r\nOur meadow has looked good this year too. Growing wildflowers, especially native varieties, has been identified as one of the best and loveliest ways of doing our bit for biodiversity. The problem is that if you want really good, long lasting results, you can’t just stop mowing. It’s better than doing nothing, but the big grasses will probably take over and prevent wild flowers from thriving. Yellow rattle is usually cited as the solution. It is a parasitic plant, weakening the grass and so giving space to other plants. You can sow seed or buy plugs: the wildflower farm at Langar has a good selection. We planted some extras in the Spring, ox eye daisies, ladies’ bedstraw, wild sweet pea, hardy geranium, purple loosestrife and, more recently cornflowers and ragged robin. All are growing reasonably well after several years alongside the original inhabitants including cow parsley and buttercups. I have also planted some species roses and a hydrangea for a bit more interest. The result is a bit messy, no bad thing that, and a lovely mixture of grasses and flowers much loved by bees, butterflies, moths and other insects. We have a resident grass snake, toads, newts and a regular foxy visitor. In spring there are lent lilies (our native daffodil), bluebells, fritillaries and a small but steadily spreading clump of wood anenomes. It’s been fun making it happen, but patience is the watchword, it doesn’t happen overnight.\r\nFrom the native and wild to the cultivated and highly ornamental, our dahlias are doing brilliantly this year. They do need a fair bit of mollycoddling, regular deadheading, staking, feeding and watering, to stay flowering and looking well. If you do all that though, they will reward you magnificently, producing their gorgeous blooms right up until the frosts. They aren’t reliably hardy but the last couple of years I have left some in the ground under a good mulch and they have survived well. I also dug up some clumps to be on the safe side. Do it after the frost has blackened the top growth, dry them out a little and store them in a cool greenhouse, porch or somewhere frost free. Keep an eye on the over the winter to make sure they don’t either dry right out or go mouldy and pop them in a pot of new soil early April. Plant out once the danger of frost has gone and they will soon get going. \r\nKeep deadheading your perennials and annuals to keep them going as long as possible or they tend to think their work is done and stop producing flowers. But don’t forget to enjoy your garden over the summer. If you are an obsessive plants person like me I know it can be hard to just sit and relax in your outside space. But give yourself a treat, make a cuppa or pour a glass and take time to appreciate all your hard work!\r\n"},
{"nid":"172","title":"Taking stock","type":"blog","created":"1569884400","body_value":"Gardening is an organic process in many ways. We can plan a grand, new planting scheme, try sowing a different kind of tomato, prune our trees and shrubs more drastically, dig a pond, establish a little wildflower meadow or perhaps plant up some new pots.  Whatever we have the time, energy, money and imagination to do. So every now and again it’s a good idea to take stock: what has worked this year and what really hasn’t. This is my stock take for 2019 so far:\r\n\r\n•\tRoses do well in our heavy clay. Buying bare root in winter or early spring from David Austin is quite expensive, but the roses are good quality and establish quickly. ‘The Lark Ascending’ is both glorious in name and flower, soft apricot and yellow tones in a lanky, but elegant bush. ‘Skylark’ is a lovely clear pink and really healthy;\r\n•\tCompost does better when turned often with plenty of green stuff such as grass clippings and comfrey to keep the heat going to enable the composting process to work well and fast;\r\n•\tBeing bold with tender perennials and a clear bright colour scheme works best. A combo of red dahlias, orange Mexican sunflowers (Tithonia ‘The Torch’), purple Verbena Bonariensis, bright purple salvias, heleniums, bronze fennel, purple Michaelmas daisies and red roses looks good for weeks and weeks;\r\n•\tAlstroemerias work best in damp-ish, decent soil and dappled shade. A.’Indian Summer’ flowered for months here at Charnwood and the blooms last for ages in a vase;\r\n•\tHostas are becoming a waste of space. Slug damage and dry spells do for them. There are better alternatives such as Rogerseras;\r\n•\tSome vegetables and fruit are worth growing more than others. Yes to runner beans, tomatoes, peppers, figs, raspberries and courgettes. No to potatoes (slug food), leafy vegetables (rabbit food), and some soft fruit (bird food);\r\n•\tRegular dead heading and weeding works better than the occasional heavy session. You get to know your garden better too if you pay close attention on a weekly, or dare I suggest, daily basis;\r\n•\tGrasses are lovely plants that can add structure as well as cohesiveness to a border. But if I’m going to make that happen I need to learn more about their individual characteristics and requirements. Miscanthus is a bit of a thug;\r\n•\tHardy geraniums rule. There is one for almost every spot and the flower for ages. They are brilliant for underplanting the bare stems of roses and shrubs. A hard cut back when they get leggy mid season prevents them becoming too messy.\r\n\r\nYour stock take will be different I’m sure, but perhaps a little reflection does no harm?\r\n\r\nWe had a holiday in Dorset early September: it is such a lovely County. Kingston Lacey, a National Trust property was a joy, especially the kitchen garden which was wonderfully and exuberantly planted with dahlias, cannas and annual bedding for bright late summer colour. Not far away is a relatively new garden, Keyneston Mill near Blandford Forum. There they grow, harvest and distil ingredients to make perfume. It is really interesting and generously planted. Excellent food too! www.keynestonmill.com\r\n\r\nAs I write the sun is shining and there is no sign of bad weather. When you read this I hope that is still the case - happy gardening!\r\n"},
{"nid":"173","title":"Posh pots","type":"blog","created":"1572566400","body_value":"If you were watching Gardeners’ World mid-October (and if not, why not I ask?) you will have seen Monty Don planting up some spring bulbs in rather posh looking terracotta pots. A close inspection I’m pretty sure, would have revealed that they are from Whichford Pottery at Shipston –on-Stour in the Cotswolds. They have a very distinctive stamp all around the neck of the pot. We paid them a visit a few weeks ago and, wow, what a find.\r\nThe pots are expensive but really good and guaranteed frost proof: not ‘frost resistant’ the rather non-committal way less expensive pots are described. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve bought many cheap and cheerful pots and enjoyed them for a year, possibly two. But they rarely last longer than that as my ever growing pile of broken pots set aside to be used as crocks in the bottom of pots will testify. So a visit to Whichford was a rare treat. Their display of planted up pots was wonderful. It seems that most plants can look good in a pot! So we are now the proud owners of several lovely new ones planted up with tulips, crocus and little daffodils. Peter fell for a large one that is now home to a new dwarf pine (pictured beside bronze heron legs!). This is to add to our Japanese themed pond and woodland garden. I’ve also got some azaleas in pots nearby so I can give them the ericaceous soil they like. The food at Whichford was delicious too, definitely worth a visit. If you get there and get the chance to have a look round the pottery workshop, I can recommend it too. The pots are all hand made on site. I would avoid the compost loo if I were you but perhaps that’s too much information….\r\nTalking of spring bulbs, I’m a sucker for daffodils. I bought a bag of Narcissus ‘Exotic Mystery’ from Hayloft plants. They were so beautiful in the catalogue I couldn’t resist and what a name! Now is a good time to get bargains from garden centres as the planting season is well underway. You can plant tulips really late on: in fact October\/November is the best time. I heard Pippa Greenwood on GQT say she’d planted tulips as late as February and they flowered and have continued to do so for many years. Just make sure they are reasonably plump and not all dried up or mouldy and they will be fine. We have a real problem with squirrels and mice eating bulbs here so I usually soak the bulbs in tonic water with quinine in before I plant them. It doesn’t always work but it’s worth a try. I’ve also chopped up some of my fresh chillies this year and covered the pots with that. Fingers crossed!\r\nI’ve been collecting seeds to sow for next year, including Tithonia, evening primrose, perennial stock and Welsh poppy. If I have any seedlings spare, I share them with pals or sell them on one of my charity plants stalls next year. Many thanks to Jean who donated me a lovely pile of clean pots, they are being well used and for a good cause. I am also keen to get some more wild flowers into our little meadow so have pinched some wild carrot seeds from the country park. The wild flowers there have been fabulous this year. \r\nThis is a good time to buy bare root plants such as roses and fruit trees as they are cheaper and establish really well if planted now. Yet again, I have been seduced by the David Austin catalogue and have bought some wonderful roses, including a gorgeous deep apricot one called ‘Morning Mist’. I will soak them in water for a few hours before planting and give them a yummy new home with plenty of compost and tlc. \r\nHappy gardening!\r\n"},

I can’t imagine the misery of being flooded, but it’s an experience all too real for some people this year. Farmers too must be counting the costs of such wet weather on their crops. \r\nOn a much less serious note it’s not brilliant in the garden either, but at least we can wait until it dries out and rainwater does have its uses.  Ericaceous plants such as Camellias, Blueberries and Azaleas all prefer rainwater to the stuff that comes out of the tap. Orchids love it too. If you rake up damp leaves and put them into a bin bag they will turn into leafmould. This makes wonderful mulch: it takes at least a year to rot down completely but it really is worth the wait. We’ve got containers roughly put together with some wooden stakes and chicken wire to tip the leaves into. They decompose slowly, basically by turning mouldy. That is why it takes much longer but the wet weather does help.\r\nOn an entirely frivolous note, my Grandma used to rinse her hair in rainwater. She said it left her hair feeling lovely and soft and fresh. I did try it when younger. Now I’m getting on a bit it seems like an activity best kept to the warmer months!\r\nWildlife writers are all advising us not to be too tidy over the winter. A wide range of creatures benefit from leaving a few leaves, dead perennials and other garden debris around for shelter and food. We had a bumper crop of apples this year so there is a slightly manky pile of them left under the hedge for the blackbirds. They are enjoying a spot of lunch from them right now outside the study window: the more rotten they are, the better they seem to like them – yummy! We had a far bit of tree work done last month so there are also a few more piles of logs and twigs for frogs, toads and hedgehogs as well as the many little invertebrates that call our garden home;  it is a privilege for us to be able to share their home.\r\nLooking for ideas for Christmas presents for gardeners? Peter bought me a copy of Beth Chatto’s biography for my birthday last month. Catherine Horwood was commissioned to write it by Beth herself before she died in May 2018, well into her nineties. I often find biographies a bit disappointing to be honest; they can be lengthy, rather dry and so a bit of a trial to get through. Not this one: it is stylishly written and really well researched.  Exerpts from Beth’s own diary help to demonstrate her lively and passionate approach to life. The book unearths not only fascinating details about Beth’s life with plants and her many travels, but also details about her rather (for the time at least) unconventional love life. Beth’s garden near Colchester is still open for visitors and is glorious. She was the first to make the ‘right plant, right place’ idea popular, which is demonstrated very well in her own garden as well as her many books. I also have her wonderful book about woodland gardening, and another entitled ‘The Dry Garden’.  Both are still in print today.\r\nI hope you have a restful, fun Christmas and Santa is good to you. If s\/he is listening,\r\n my favourite stocking filler is a decent size ball of string to tie up my climbing plants. I’ll be back in February when the snowdrops will be out and all the gorgeous spring bulbs will be pushing through the soil. All the best for 2020!\r\n"}
